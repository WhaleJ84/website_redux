5	PastNet 2019	pastnet2019	2020-05-05	2019-05-11	2019-05-11	Hackathon	Team MIND go to Oxford University to compete against other teams in a hackathon aimed around feeding past data into visualisation algorithms.	past_net_19	<p>I was originally introduced to the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/pastnet-hackathon-network-science-of-the-past-tickets-58541996688#">PastNet Hackathon</a> by Prins, who told me that the event was about\n networking - which was a skill of mine I've wanted to put to good use since starting my course.\nI agreed to sign up before the event handlers had even released any substantial information as to what the hackathon was even about.\nWeeks went by and the event had completely escaped my mind as no new information was being released for it.\nWe knew in advance our team would consist of past members; Prins Butt, Denise Tineghe, Josh Arrowsmith, myself and new timer, Ryan Jordan.\nWe students were out celebrating in town for finishing our year at University, partying late into the night the night before and planning to go home and get some sleep before we had to wake up early to drive up to\nOxford the next day.\nNeedless to day, I didn't sleep at all and the member of the team who had the most sleep got 4 hours - something that was seeming to become an inevitable tradition when it comes to hackathons for us.</p>\n<p>Leaving at 7am for Oxford as a team, we arrive slightly late due to traffic but manage to still catch the opening presentations which told us what the hackathon was all about.\nThe hackathon organisers were all Oxford PhD students and they introduced several different members of the team, saying where they specialised and what they expected of us - the vast majority of them were in Archae\nology related studies.\nThis is where I learned I was lied to.\nThe hackathon wasn't to do with networking at all, but instead about feeding past data into visualisation algorithms and making sense of the output, with the main data focus being Roman clay pots.\nRegardless of this betrayal, we were still ready to put our minds to use and see what we could make of our situation as I kept fuelling myself with coffee to try combat the lack of sleep during the day.</p>\n<p>After sitting through a few hours of presentations, we only had about 4 hours to come up with an idea for our project and begin developing it - something that has been far more restrictive due to time constraint\ns compared to all last events, which proved a very difficult obstacle when it comes to developing an innovative idea.\nOne thing we all agreed on was that we didn't want to use data for Roman clay pots or any other past data they recommended to us for our project as we felt that wasn't what made our team motivated.\nDue to that fact, we ended up with far less time to make a working implementation for our project as we had to devote a lot of our time thinking of what is was we wanted to tackle.\nThe criteria we took from the organisers that we needed to meet was that it had to be past data and it had to be able to be fed into a visualisation algorithm for us to do something with the output.\nWith that information in mind, we left the building and sat outside on the grass next to a fountain with ducks to think with clear minds.</p>\n<p>After much discussion, we concluded that we wanted to tackle the issue of mental health, which is a serious issue within our society but still needed to decide how we were going to do that.\nAs usual we spit-balled as many different ideas that came to our heads as possible and weighed all their likelihood of being a strong standpoint to begin to combating mental health.\nOur final idea was to take past social media posts and feed only the use of emojis into the visualisation algorithm to get a general idea as to the overall mental health of the population in any given area.\nWe could in future versions find out what it is in particular that is causing these people to use more negative emojis.</p>\n<p>By the time that idea was finalised we only had about 2 hours to make our project into a presentation, so we split into mini groups to focus on individual aspects simultaneously.\nJosh and Ryan worked on the presentation slides, Denise created an infographic on the state of mental health and myself and Prins focused on creating the graphical interface that would present the visualised data a\ns emojis on a map.\nWe spent time developing the beginnings of the interface in C# but very quickly realised that the time we had remaining was not enough to develop a program that could use the Twitter API to scrape tweets and feed t\nhat into our program.\nWe decided that our best option was to produce proof of concept slides that would show a rough idea as to what our project foresaw.</p>\n<p>As we were outside and had laptops, we needed to find somewhere with an internet connection and power sockets.\nThe Oxford building was available to us, but it was very cramped in there and we wanted somewhere to have more privacy.\nWe walked around Oxford looking for a place to work.\nHaving tried many places (including the history museum), we eventually found a small cafe that provided all we needed, losing us about 45 minutes in the process.\nWith no time to lose, we all kept our heads down and got working hard to try meet our deadline, talking to each other where needed to get feedback but ultimately working independently of one another.\nWe gave ourselves 15 minutes to group all our work together and walk back to the university in time for the final presentations.</p>\n<p>Due to the lack of sleep, my memory of the events are a bit hazy.\nI think it was around the time of arrival for the presentations that the hackathon organisers had a lunch prepared for us on a higher floor of the building.\nWe worked our way up there to see what was on offer.\nSide note about me - I <em>really</em> don't enjoy eating most healthy foods.\nMost of today's society is trying to eliminate people like me through attrition by making sure all sandwiches contain either mayonnaise or a bunch of healthy salad stuff.\nBack to the point - all the food there was healthy... <em>too healthy</em>.\nI was left to starve.</p>\n<p>Hungry, tired and over-caffeinated, my body was refusing to work more than I was refusing to eat the rabbit food on offer.\nLooking around the room, I noticed a familiar face on the far side talking to two women.\nThe face was the boyfriend to a dear friend of mine who lives in Southampton - why would her boyfriend be all the way out here? To do a hackathon like me, of course.\nI walked over there to say hello.\nAs he is in conversation with the two ladies I don't interrupt, I just stood there waiting for the conversation to finish.\nThe man was aware I was there, and I was curious as to why he didn't immediately acknowledge me and say hello at least.\nJust as the conversation between he and the ladies got awkward due to my presence, it dawned upon me.\nI did not know this man because he was my friend's boyfriend; I knew his man because I sat next to him in the introduction.\nEmbarrassed, and too tired to come up with some fake conversation, I waved and said hello to them all and then quickly walked off.\nI had to ensure my eyes did not meet his, nor the ladies the entire time we were up there until we all went down for presentations.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving, we volunteered to present first but as usual we kept the number of people going up to present to a minimum, being only Prins and Denise.\nWith not enough time to study through what everyone had produced or even rehearse the presentation, it was mostly improvisation on Prins' part, of which he handled gracefully.\nThey gave a 3 minute presentation showing the others what we had created with our given time.\nAfter the time was up, the judges asked questions for each of the presentations, and watched all the other teams present their submissions.\nMost of the other teams also consisted of Oxford PhD students and they all gave their presentations of feeding past data of Roman clay pots into the algorithm and having similar outcomes to each other.\nI thought those who didn't study history were doomed to repeat it.\nOnce all the presentations were given, the judges left the room for 5 minutes to decide on their winning teams.\nWe felt our team had thought really outside of the box and tried to make something of real impact, hoping that would bide well with the judges.\nWhen the judges returned, they first stressed that they decided on their winners on those who met the criteria the most and announced the teams that won 1st, 2nd and 3rd place; positions that we did not achieve.\nIt seemed that the judges were only interested in those who used the past data that they suggested, but we still won prizes regardless, all walking away with mini gifts - myself, an egg timer.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we were all very happy that we chose what we did, otherwise the event would\nnot have been as engaging as we'd have liked and the day over all was an enjoyable experience.\nWe developed an idea that we felt had real weight to it and would iterate on it in future hackathons to come.\nAfter the event finished, we explored Oxford city for a while before coming back to Southampton and enjoying a night celebrating our experience.</p>	f	2020-10-17
7	Hack Coworking 2019	hackcoworking2019	2020-05-07	2019-06-15	2019-06-16	Hackathon	Once again Team Solent travel to London, creating three small teams to solve all three challenges presented during the event.	hack_coworking_19	<p>On a roll from going to one hackathon to the next, a handful of previous members signed up for <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hack-coworking-future-of-work-and-workspaces-hackathon-tickets-46883666308#">Hack Coworking</a>, an event aimed at coming up with solutions to do with bringing innovation to the coworking space, tailored for and sponsored by 6 companies who would judge the submissions.\nThe members attending this time would be Patrick West, Denise Tineghe, Ryan Jordan, Prins Butt and myself - all squeezed into a 5 seater hire car driving back up to London less than a month after our last hackathon there.\nWe got to the same hostel as before a night early to ensure we could get to the event on time, relying on the London Underground this time to eliminate traffic, learning from our experience before.\nAlthough I've been to London a handful of times now, knowing how to effectively navigate yourself around there is something that takes time to learn.\nA lot of things are different than to those in other cities and to cut a long story short, we didn't get there on time (big surprise) but thankfully only by a short while.</p>\n<p>As a security student, I'm fascinated by the physical security that a lot of buildings have implemented within the city - it's a far cry from what I'm used to and a joy to learn how they handle it within the capital.\nBeing escorted to an elevator with no buttons and controlled by the receptionist to take me to the only floor I'm authorised on, we arrive at the event and are greeted by a huge group of people.\nEveryone mingled over the breakfast provided and we bumped into a man we had on our team back when we did the <a href="blog_firehack2019.html">Fire Hack</a>, Justin.\nOf all the people in London, we happened to see him again and it was nice to see his friendly face.\nLike last time, Justin didn't come with a team but we were already at our max team size so this time he would have to join another.</p>\n<p>Breakfast finished and the event handlers introduced themselves and what the hackathon was all about, introducing the judges and sponsors, followed by mini games to get people to network and help find teams for those who didn't have one yet.\nI liked this approach, as at most hackathons there's no time to get to know the people around you - not if you're serious about what you're there for, so I spent the time learning about the other attendees and shared knowledge about my previous hackathons to those whose first event it was.\nAfter the games were done, everyone went off into different sections of the floor and thankfully our team managed to get a small room all to ourselves.\nOnce inside, we decided our plan for the hack, which would be to split into 3 mini teams and tackle all three challenges that were presented.\nRyan and Denise would work on the Salto challenge, finding a new use of their technology.\nMyself and Patrick took on HB Reavis' (HBR) challenge, coming up with ways to improve the services they provide.\nFinally Prins would work on his own, figuring out a way to innovate Cobot's service, although he would spend the vast majority of his time helping both teams.</p>\n<p>With our game plan decided, Ryan and Denise went off to work on their project in silence while the rest of us started with our usual starting point of coming up with as many different ideas as possible and narrowing down the list to the worthy few.\nThis step always takes a lot of time, as you don't want to start one project only to scrap it later down the line, and not only that; also thinking of something that every other team likely isn't already doing.\nAfter a few hours of researching what HBR already provided, we figured out something they weren't - environments tailored for the individual, rather than for the masses.\nWe understood why HBR had everything was it was, for practical reasons mostly, but we figured if we could design a system that would allow customers to set their own preferences as to how they liked their working environments, we could then filter down available coworking spaces to find one that suits the customer the most.\nNow our direction was set, we had to break it down even further to decide how we were going to get that done.</p>\n<p>After all the things we've learned from prior hackathons, the thing that stands out the most is that the presentation is key - getting a working demo is surprisingly not what guarantees a winning vote, so with mine and Prin's experience whipping up quick prototypes in C#, he suggested I use that to develop the software while Patrick got more information from HBR and worked on external parts that would feed in.\nPrins' guidance had won us prizes at every single hackathon we attended prior, so after a small discussion how we both felt a web app would be more appropriate as we could feed into HBR's existing products with it, we ultimately went with his suggested path.\nPatrick is a rather charismatic man, so for him to get talking with the companies was the right choice while I started preparing the project for development and helping Prins come up with ideas for his challenge.\nFor the next 5 hours, development would move slowly as we all kept in touch with one another, overcoming any issues as they came.</p>\n<p>I kept feeling that it didn't make sense to create a C# program for our challenge, so after much discussion with Patrick and Prins, myself and Patrick scrapped our current work and began working on a web app instead.\nWe felt this path was better as my knowledge with C# is minimal while we both had experience with web development.\nPatrick began creating a website with Bootstrap while I began working on creating heat maps for one of our pitch's selling point.\nOnce again, my hackathon experience was learning something completely new (how to generate and work with heat maps) instead of using my strong skills I already have, but that's part of the fun.\nIt turns out that within the short time we had, no amount of google results provided me with free software that could generate heat maps, so I had to rely on online services that could generate them for me.\nFiltering through from service to service, eliminating the ones that wouldn't work, we finally found our best bet - but it was capped at 200 data points while the data HBR provided us with had hundreds of thousands.</p>\n<p>For the rest of my night there, my role was to import the csv files into spreadsheet software and sanitise the data into values the online service could handle, before cutting the thousands of entries down to 200 worthy data points.\nAfter crashing the online service multiple times during testing and finally creating a suitable dataset, we received our first working heat map generation after a very long wait.\nThe image that the heat map was generated over was a random floor plan we got off Google, but as the data fed into it was from a completely different building, the generation looked all off.\nWith all the effort we had put into the heat map thus far, we refused to have the generation be presented like that, so we began working on an algorithm that would take the different x and y coordinates of any generated map and then modify the dataset so it would fit within the boundaries of the map.\nThis turned out to be a very big task and thankfully there was a whiteboard in our room, so we began writing out multiple different calculations to try and figure out our best course of action.\nAs time went on, the 'solution' to our problem got bigger and bigger so we decided that it wasn't worth continuing and that our best option was to ask HBR for the floor plan the data was collected from and generate over that instead.</p>\n<p>Patrick went off to speak with them once again while I took over with the web development.\nI hadn't used Bootstrap before and I didn't have time to learn it, so I took a copy of his index page and created a new page to work on the user's preferences.\nThe index page so far was designed to show what our future implementations would hold as well as showing off our heat maps for the buildings.\nI'm no professional web developer (could you tell?) but it felt very dirty having a mix between Bootstrapped code, no separate CSS and JavaScript files and the inconsistencies between our two coding styles - regardless, we didn't have time; as long as it worked, it worked.\nI created a rough design for how we would handle the preferences before Patrick returned, asking me to come with him to the HBR people.\nHe told me to listen to what they told him and I learned that they already had a virtual overview of their buildings with different overlays for things such as temperature and occupancy, something that wasn't obvious on their website, nor presented at the beginning.\nThis made my heart drop, as I thought we had wasted all that time for nothing new, but we were told to continue working on the heat maps regardless, as the way we were using them was different and a new outlook.\nWith that coming from one of the people who would be judging us, we continued on and they sent us the floor plan to work with.\nWe had all the parts we needed now to get it working, right? If only it were that simple.</p>\n<p>After taking the image provided and editing it to something that was acceptable to the web generation, as the service wouldn't accept maps that were over a certain size, the size we could use was out of sync with our dataset.\nOnce again we had to work on an algorithm that could work out the resolution of the map, the distance in pixels between each x or y coordinate incrementation, and then a way to scale the dataset values down into new ones that would match the new sized map.\nBy this point we realised that there was no way that we could get this even close to working in time for the submission date the next day, so we instead focused our time on finding example replacements for the heat maps and the website.\nBefore long we went home for the night.</p>\n<p>Arriving for breakfast the next morning, we had until 12 o'clock to submit our projects so everyone kept their heads down and was working hard to get things ready for the submission.\nMyself and Patrick had created a website just basic enough to show off what we wanted to pitch and then I focused on creating our presentation while Patrick filled in the submission forms and profiles.\nWith that complete I helped Prins however I could with what little time we had left and after the deadline passed, we had time to kill before the presentations began.\nAs me and Patrick were on a mini team, I would be up on stage presenting this time.\nNormally we try to keep the people going up on stage to a minimum as idle people standing around does not look professional, but as we were just a team of two, we were both going up and naturally letting the presentation flow between us both.\nWhen presentation time came, as always I made sure to get pictures of our fellow member's presentations as they were up on stage, not paying much thought as to what might go wrong during my own and as such, something slipped by me.</p>\n<p>I've been a Linux user for years now and been trying out new flavours often, but over the past few months I've been using the i3 window manager.\nOne thing I like about i3 is that you pretty much code everything yourself so it is to your own liking and one thing I forgot is that I hadn't got round to creating something to handle the resolutions for external screens.\nSo far my HDMI port had been hard-coded for my setup at home and for the screens at our university, and once it was our turn to present up on stage I was faced with that issue.\nAll the files were on my laptop and nothing was showing on the big screen.\nI had completely forgot about the issue prior and now did not have enough time to fix it live.\nWe were contemplating pitching without the demo and presentation slides, but thankfully the event handlers let me send the presentation to their already connected machine and we ran it from there but without our demo.\nWe gave our presentation to the best of our abilities and returned to our seats when finished as I was going through my head over every possible reason why my laptop failed, before I finally remembered that I never got round to properly implementing it.\nTo our surprise, the organisers allocated us an extra minute to present our demo at the end of everyone's presentations, so I sent the files to Patrick's laptop and we gave a very quick demo as to what we created and how our idea could benefit HBR.</p>\n<p>With the pitch over and all presentations finished, the judges left the room to decide while a representative from one of the sponsors gave a talk.\nWhen the talk was finished and the judges returned they announced the winners for each challenge one by one, of which neither of our teams won this time.\nThis was our first time leaving a hackathon without any prizes, but the fact that the prizes involved money meant that the competition was much harder.\nRegardless of our streak ending, the challenge was a welcome experience and our time there was great overall.\nMaybe in an alternate reality, I followed through with Prins' direction and we won, but I am happy we cut our losses and made the choices we did.\nSince then I have created a script to handle the resolution of external screens and will be asking to test my machine on the stage before show time starts in future.</p>	f	2020-10-17
2	Open Day March 2019	opendaymarch2019	2020-05-02	2019-03-06	2019-03-06	University event	The first time I've worked during a Solent Open Day representing the Computing department and presenting my experience as a student so far.	open_day_march_19	<p>Often when people think about events being hosted, they never think about the people who actually host said events.\nIf they do there's an image that there's always a huge pool of people just waiting to take up the opportunity.\nIn reality, when you learn how life really is, you find that very few people actually take the opportunities there are out there.\nI used to be one of those people, I used to be a lot of a person, yet I'm even more of one now.\nAfter hearing that there are opportunities to be paid by the university to talk about your experience during open days, my initial thought was <em>'Easy money!'</em>.\nI applied for the role, expecting to hear that there was already a huge line of better suited people waiting before me, yet I got accepted for the job.</p>\n<p>Prior to the event, I knew that I would have to man a desk, answer any questions about the course and give a presentation about my experience so far.\nThe latter part required I create a presentation that would be interesting to others, which was the hardest part.\nHow do you take your academic life and turn it into something interesting to others?</p>\n<p>Thankfully for me, I have been taking on a multitude of different activities and opportunities since joining and had a lot to talk about.\nWhen it came to putting that into the presentation, it's hard to not make it look boring, especially if you don't have images to back it up - something re-enforced during my time creating this website.\nIn the weeks before the event, I had time to iterate through multiple versions of the presentation and came up with a script as if the entire thing would be some sort of play.\nAs I'm sure a lot of people relate to, we barely ever follow the script.</p>\n<p>On the day, I arrive on time and head to my allotted area where I have to man a desk and answer any queries potential future student may have at me.\nI'm sure a lot of people in computing can relate to the fact we were located down in the basement level.\nNormally I find it hard to fake a smile, but when you when you take time out your daily life to help other people a smile comes naturally.\nPaired with fellow computing students (of which many of us were friends), we kept at our stations until mid-day, greeting and helping visitors when needed while having fun between us during gaps.</p>\n<p>After mid-day, we hosted a mini event within the computing event for those who wish to come where the lecturers spoke about what future students can expect from the university.\nThis was followed by talks from current students about our experience thus far.\nOther than a gig I had to do for my Music course in college many years before, I have never done anything that regards facing the public, presenting to a group of strangers was a very new thing to me.\nIn my mind I had an entire script to follow word for word to get through the day.\nWhen I went up there and got into the flow of things, I found that it's a lot more natural if you speak from your heart with what comes on the spot, regardless of if what you wrote before was just as meaningful.</p\n>\n<p>For the next 10 minutes, I gave my journey: starting from a mature student unsure if he's ready to get back into education, all the way up to now, taking on every opportunity I can and never looking back.\nI'm sure to some, the entire thing looked like I had a pre-defined script written by the university that I was paid to follow.\nFor me it was a joy to let out in words what it is you've achieved and how much you've grown in such little time.\nWhat was even more gratifying was having individuals approaching me, impressed and inspired about what I said; letting me know that even something as little as just helping yourself can still help others inadverten\ntly.</p>\n<p>After the event had ended, our group as friends went out for a fun evening together, enjoying each other's company and creating fond memories.\nThis was something that became a tradition for our group at many more events to come.\nOverall, I learned a lot from my time attending as it got me to think about how my actions have been influenced by those around me.\nIt made me think about how my actions could influence those to come and makes me look forward for the further Open Days to come.</p>	f	2020-10-17
3	Fire Hack 2019	firehack2019	2020-05-03	2019-03-29	2019-03-31	Hackathon	This hackathon entailed developing solutions to command and control simulated UAVs to detect and map out wildfires in a joint event between UK and US teams, where our team, Promise, came second and won the Innovation award.	fire_hack_19	<p>During 'Hack the South 2019' a month prior we were all given cards promoting <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/2019-fire-hack-registration-53590796515#">Fire Hack 2019</a>, an upcoming hackathon the following month.\nThe event was looking for teams of 4-8 people in a 3 day event with challenges increasing in complexity.\nTeams were required to design and implement algorithms to command and control UAVs to search and map for simulated wildfires.\nIn the weeks following Hack the South, the event would also be advertised by the computing department at Solent University and teams were being formed of those wanting to join the event.\nI joined a balanced team of people when it came to skill and knew all the members well, including Skip, one of the same members I was with during Hack the South.</p>\n<p>Once all the students who wanted the attended the event had signed up, it resulted in two teams, each lead by a lecturer from the Computing department.\nOur team leader was Prins Butt, a programming lecturer and along with him the team consisted of Skip Barden (web developer), James Richardson (software engineer), Aaron Jenkins (software engineer), Denise Tineghe (business information technology), Tobiasz Kaduk (computing) and myself.\nBetween us we covered a wide area of expertise and Prins had plans for us all.\nHe, James and Aaron would be the coding force behind the project while the rest of us would break each scenario down into separate modules and theorise algorithms as to how each one could be solved through code.</p>\n<p>With the teams created, we had a month to sign the legal contract, download the simulation software and practice by completing and submitting Challenge 0 before the event started.\nTo make this more fun, we had a little rivalry between both Solent teams and was jokingly secretive between us from the start as we made plans to meet up at regular times prior to the event and get ahead of the other team.\nWe were a big team, so finding a time that we were all free and could meet up to practice was hard, but we were also university students that wanted to have fun when we did meet up, which was even harder.\nBy the time the event came around, we had barely all got the simulation software installed on our laptops, let alone completed the challenge so we had no preparation done before-hand.</p>\n<p>Days before the event, one of our team members (unnamed) dropped out for personal reasons, leaving our team a man down for the hackathon.\nMiscellaneous challenges were in place for attendees to win Raspberry Pi 3b+'s during the event.\n50 were won by the first people who submitted Challenge 0 (which we did not), so we wanted to win at least something during our time there.\nAdditionally, the first 25 people to arrive on the day would also receive one, so our team all agreed to meet up before the event and each win our Pi's.\nWhile waiting in line, a man in his 40's-50's was walking around the groups and introducing himself.\nHe said hello to us and was very friendly; his name was Justin.\nJustin came from London just to attend the event but didn't have a team.\nThis was convenient for us as we were a man down and offered him a place as we got to know more about him.\nHe had a background in many different areas in computing but wanted to join the coders in the development of the software.</p>\n<p>The rest of the first day entailed the event organisers introducing everyone and helping people set up.\nOur team found a table and got to work breaking down Scenario 1, deciding what searching pattern we would begin coding for our initial algorithm.\nWe spent many hours jotting down any possible patterns we could think of, silly or not, then slowly filtering through all the possibilities until we were left with a set of search patterns that were all robust in their own ways.\nMost of the other teams defaulted to a spiral search pattern, slowly spiralling into the centre of the map.\nWhile this was a good way to search the map with just one UAV, we wanted our pattern to be a single pattern that could be multiplied to facilitate for any number of UAVs we had at our disposal.\nTo prevent this blog being a magnitude larger than it already is, I will omit the research stage of this and tell you that our final algorithm functioned closely to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve" target="_blank">Hilbert Curve</a> (of which we took no inspiration from when designing it).\nOur patternwas slightly different, only using right turns to ensure that everything would always be relative to clockwise-directions.</p>\n<p>By this point, it was 10pm and the building was closing for the night.\nWe all decided to go out and have some fun in the town with Justin.\nI was driving and only joined in with the junk food.\nWe got lots of pizzas and went back to Justin's hotel room where we continued to do some light work and have fun until about 2am where I drove home to sleep.\nThe building opened again at 8:30am the following morning but I was so tired from the day before that I slept in and arrived at around 11 instead.\nEveryone was there but Justin, working hard as we had until 2pm to submit Challenge 1 before the next challenge was released.\nHaving only just deciding on what pattern we wanted, we were nowhere near close to even having a working client.\nThe trade-off was worth it as we had everyone on the same level, agreeing what we had was something that could work in multiple situations.\nThe coders continued their challenge of putting our design into lines of code that could be used in an object-oriented manner.\nThe think-tank worked out solutions to how the drones would be allocated to different paths and what they should do once they detect a fire.</p>\n<p>The rest of my day would entail myself going through multiple different designs and ideas, critiquing every one with a high level of scrutiny.\nMy fellow teams members would verify to ensure that any designs that did pass through different stages had been poked and prodded as many was we could to see how it would fit alongside our current algorithm that was in development.\nWe didn't have anything to submit for both Challenge 1 and 2 that day, meaning our last chance was for Challenge 3 the next day.\nInstead of going out to have fun again later that night, we went to the university library which was open 24/7 for the event and continued our work until the late hours of the morning.\nOne by one, members of the team got too tired and left to go home to bed until all who remained were myself, Prins and James.\nWe still did not have a fully functioning version of the search algorithm yet.\nI assisted the coders by suggesting different ways we could handle the code from my understanding as to how all our algorithms were theorised.\nThe lack of preparation before the event, paired with how much background calculations we had to do in order to achieve simple tasks was proving to hold back the coding side pretty bad.</p>\n<p>The algorithm would determine the width and length of the given map as well as a centre point that was a latitude/longitude co-ordinates.\nThose numbers would allow us to automatically gather latitude/longitude coordinates from any point in the map that we required on the fly, but it is a lot easier to explain than it was so code.\nWe kept working until around 5:30am, where we were so exhausted and frustrated that the manic laughing I experienced at the last hackathon was occurring to my members around me, spreading like a contagious disease.\nI got some fresh air to wake up and insisted to drive Prins home, returning to the Library to continue working with James on trying to get the code working.\nWe tried our best to keep fighting through it but the exhaustion hit me again shortly after I began reading through the API and code once more.\nWhat I had planned to be closing my eyes for 10 minutes resulted in me falling asleep on the table until 8:30am, where I noticed James passed out also.\nWe got our stuff and moved over to the main building to get some breakfast and try continue work but shortly passed out again.</p>\n<p>Some time later we were woke by Prins, who made his way back in and was ready to fight the code with a (somehow) rested mind.\nSlowly, all but Justin still would arrive and continue working on required areas.\nThe final submission had to be in by noon and we still didn't have our code working.\nSkip had also been working on an app idea over the days that could be used to assist the services in locating the fires alongside working on presentation slides for our project.\nThe three coders were back at it and getting a working version so close to completion.\nI kept assisting them in debating how the code should work, as well as developing methods the UAVs could use to map out the fires.</p>\n<p>With less than half an hour to spare, we got the code working - and it worked gloriously.\nAll that time spent ignoring the other submissions was worth it.\nWhat we had was something so robust that it would work across every scenario without a hitch.\nThe code was working, Skip completed the app design, we all filled out the necessary forms and created a presentation to sell our team's work.</p>\n<p>The judges came round to every team one by one and gave a chance for the team to present themselves.\nWe left our presentation to Prins and Skip to give to ensure it wasn't too crowded.\nThe research shown that was put into the design of the algorithm, the dedication we shown to get it working and the confidence we showed in its complexity, paired with the data input we could get from the app idea proved to be a very strong selling point.\nAs all the teams were thanked for their efforts in the event our team was not included, which was a good sign.\nOur team was called up on stage and given the Innovation award, for thinking outside the box with our app and how different our search algorithm was from everyone else's.\nWe were also informed that we were very closely considered as first place but ultimately had to be given second, but something we were all extremely proud of none-the-less.</p>\n<p>We did not go to the event hell-bent on winning; we just arrived wanting to learn new things and have fun - and that's what we did but just so happened to win prizes at the same time, which is always a plus.\nIf I could go back and do it again, I would have made it so that both teams from the university did Challenge 0 together to ensure we were all prepared before the event started, but the event was still an invaluable experience.</p>	f	2020-10-17

I can see why students are seen in a different light.</p>\n<p>Once we arrived, the hosts were gracious enough to brief us again separately to get us up to speed as to what was expected from the event.\nThe two partner representatives from <a href="https://thamesfestivaltrust.org/" target="_blank">Thames Festival Trust</a> and <a href="https://www.hidden-histories.org/" target="_blank">Eastside Community Heritage</a> introduced themselves and explained that Thames Festival Trust (TFT) were looking for unique ways to allow others to perceive past smells through indirect means, and Eastside Community Heritage (ECH) were after\na solution to host all their content in ways that were beneficial to their cause.\nSpeaking to the representatives to get to know their issues in a more intimate manner allowed us to individually come up with different ways that we may be able to tackle the tasks at hand.\nWe decided that the majority of us would remain as one mini-group to work on ECH while Josh and Tobiasz would work on TFT's smell conundrum, as Tobiasz is very good at researching topics in depth and Josh has a creative perspective on matters.</p>\n<p>One thing that we always try to do as a team is to think outside of the box to come up with unique ideas, as anyone can use boiler plate examples to have routine solutions for any given problem, but for us to be able to try and come up with new creations every time allows for better solutions to be created.\nWe expected everyone would just try to recreate ECH's website for them (which was something they said they could do themselves) so we opted to try and refine the way they go about collecting their stories, which is what takes them the most amount of time.</p>\n<p>We were provided with a small chunk of ECH's database file structure, including articles, images, audio and video.\nMyself and James (referred to Orange and Green respectively, by the colour our name tags were written in) looked at this structure and began working on a new way to organise it all that would feed in to the rest of the project in a more modular manner, as it's current state was a bit disorganised.\nDenise and Ryan worked on a mobile application mock-up that would minimise the work the ECH volunteers would have to do when out collecting new stories by organising all the different steps into miniature functions the app could help with.\nPrins helped orchestrate both teams and would speak with the organisers to get more information while working on our presentation.\nAfter attending all the provided workshops and getting the information we needed, we decided we could continue our work back at the hostel, allowing us to get a bit of rest while working in a more comfortable environment.\nSome members went to work up in their rooms while myself, James, Josh and Tobiasz went to the hostel's bar and worked outside while chatting over a few drinks, enjoying our night together until the late hours of the morning before we went to bed.</p>\n<p>Arriving the next morning, we knew that we only had until the evening before we had to present our pitches to the judges. Josh and Tobiasz gave their team the name Aroma to suit their task at hand, and were asking for input on their project, but barring a few minor points we could add, they were mostly on their own with their complex issue.\nAs with every hackathon prior, we are constantly coming up with new ideas and questioning if our current path is the best one, but with what little time we have we have to commit and just try our best.\nThe rest of the day was mostly everyone keeping their heads down and trying to get as much done as possible to be able to link all our pieces together.\nMyself and James had created a new database and was working on getting the right types of metadata for all the collected information to be easily searchable.\nWhen the deadline was looming close, we all finished our tasks and helped Prins with the presentation to finalise everything together.\nJosh and Tobiasz also finished their project too and we all waited our turn as we watched people present one by one.\nPrins and Denise presented our project while both Josh and Tobiasz did theirs, both teams answering questions from the judges after the presentation before returning to the stands and watching the others.</p>\n<p>Once the presentations had ended, the judges all left the room to decide on the winners.\nDuring that time, we mingled with the other attendees to get to know one another.\nWe got speaking with the organisers who filmed us while asking for feedback on the event before the judges returned and announced the winners for ECH and TFT.\nThe two winners announced were from other teams, but then they surprised us to announce that they were creating a third award due to the originality of an idea - that idea was Team Aroma's.\nJosh and Tobiasz's project used a pre-existing mechanical device that could take smells and create a digital signal from that.\nWith said digital signal they pitched to create an entire database of digital smells, that once complete enough could use a combination synthetic smells that can be created to make representations of the smells TFT were looking for.</p>\n<p>Amazed by their achievement, Josh and Tobiasz collected their rewards and we all went on home, celebrating another win for Solent.\nOur time at the UCL was enjoyable as it made us look at a project from a business standpoint rather than just a simple code project that previous hackathons amounted to.\nAlthough the mini team I was on did not win the place we wanted, I learned a lot in the process, including the importance of knowing what it is that the client truly wants and how to co-operate within a team.</p>	f	2020-10-17
4	Open Day April 2019	opendayapril2019	2020-05-04	2019-04-09	2019-04-09	University event	This article logs my second Open Day, allowing me to improve my performance from the experience gained from the prior event.	open_day_april_19	<p>After working at the last Open Day, I felt a lot more confident about working more of the events.\nThis time was a lot easier as I already had my presentation created from the last time.\nThe schedule was the same as always - 9:30 start, manning the computing desk and greeting any visitors that come our way with questions.\nThis time there were only three of us hosting; Denise Tineghe, Josh Arrowsmith and myself, people who I have worked with before at previous Hackathons and events.\nFor a work day, the time during these events goes ridiculously fast.\nWe manned the computing desk in the basement once more and talked amongst ourselves as we prepared work to show to any visitors that wished to see what our studies entail.</p>\n<p>Before we knew it the time had come again to migrate up to the computing labs and give our presentations on what our journey has been like at the university so far.\nLast time, there were so many visitors that we split the group in two and had 3 of the students go in the other room to present and me on my own to talk about the networking course.\nThis time the group was small enough to keep together, so it was nice to see how other people's presentations played out and how they present themselves to others.\nDenise showed off her Twitter account, explaining all the events she's been to and won, Josh spoke about how he's grown into the confident person he is now across the past two years, and I gave an updated present\nation from last time.</p>\n<p>At the end of the talks, we go around the room and speak individually with the visitors and answer any questions they may have about the course and get to know them better.\nWhen all the visitors were happy with what they saw and left the room, we returned down to the desk until the end of our shift.\nLike last time, we celebrated the end of the day by going out together and having a great time.</p>	f	2020-10-17
1	Hack the South 2019	hackthesouth2019	2020-05-01	2019-02-09	2019-02-10	Hackathon	My first hackathon where our team, LightVision, developed a web application which reads out presented objects to the visually-impaired, winning third place and the Best Use of Google Cloud awards.	hack_south_19	<p>Originally pitched to me as nothing more than the sentence <em>'Join my team.'</em> from a friend, the idea of a hackathon was entirely new to me.\nWith it containing the word 'Hack' and me being a cyber security student, a completely different event was in mind.\nAfter looking up the web page for <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hack-the-south-2019-tickets-52945203529#" target="_blank">Hack the South 2019</a>, I was convinced that my current skills as a security student would be of no use to a team in a hackathon.\nRegardless, I was still asked to join anyway and decided to come along to see what I do to help the team.\nThe members forming the team was still unclear to me other than the one who asked me.</p>\n<p>It was both a blessing and a curse that I was invited to a night out at a friend's birthday party the night before.\nA blessing because they lived near Southampton University (where Hack the South was hosted) and offered for me to sleep on the couch, and a curse for reasons you can imagine.\nRestlessly, I left the house at 8am the following morning with less than 4 hours sleep.\nThe walk to the university was a nice way to wake up and let my imagination run loose as to what the weekend would hold for me, of which no scenario in my mind ever came close to the reality.</p>\n<p>I arrived on-site for 9am and meet with Skip, the friend who invited me onto their team.\nWe were left waiting in hope that the other members that were into the team would arrive before the event started.\nAll but one would arrive within the hour and all of which were members from within the Solent University computing department.\nBy 1pm (typical for a group of students) the final member of our team woke up and arrived at the event ASAP.\nOur team was complete with 5 members; Skip Barden, Kristoff Holthaus, Patrick West, Josh Arrowsmith and myself.\nSkip, whose idea we created for the event, was adamant that they wanted to created something "Tech for Good", meaning that the product had to help humanity.\nThey wanted us to create an app that would use the camera on the user's device to point at an object and read out what the object was.\nThe project was intended for the visually impaired and anyone else who could benefit from it.</p>\n<p>With the team assembled and the plan in place, the question came as to which roles everyone had.\nSkip studied a web development course and is very artistic, so Skip worked on the website, art and presentation for the app, while integrating an existing fallback computer vision algorithm.\nKristoff, who is experienced in machine learning, began work on creating a custom algorithm that would provide far better accuracy and reliability for the app once completed.\nPatrick used a Raspberry Pi and Pi-Camera, creating a program that would take images, reformat them as required and send them to the algorithm.\nJosh assisted Skip in creating the website for the application while Skip worked on other areas as needed.\nFinally, I took on the role learning how to use a cloud computing platform which ended up being a far bigger task than I imagined.\nIt had to take in the images from Patrick's program, feed that into Kristoff's machine learning algorithm for processing, then pass the completed information through to Skip and Josh's web application to provide to the user.</p>\n<p>I had very little knowledge of cloud computing from before, but what I did have was an extensive background in using Linux systems.\nMy initial idea was to use the IBM Cloud and NodeRED as I had learned a bit about the platform from attending an IBM Workshop previously.\nI began to dig through the platform and looking at all the nodes that could benefit us in our development.\nOne of the awards during Hack the South was for the 'Best use of Google Cloud', so we instead decided to go with that to be in the running for the prize.\nWith little knowledge of cloud computing and none using Google Cloud, the rest of my time at the event would mainly be reading through documentation.\nThis entailed building the virtual machines required (which thankfully were Linux VM's!) and working out the endless amount of errors.\nMost errors came from the fact that I had to deviate from the documentation to try suit our needs, requiring more and more adaptations as time went on.</p>\n<p>To remove as many bottlenecks as I could from my workflow, I gathered sample images of objects that were in the format that Kristoff's algorithm expected.\nThis eliminated the need of any input from Patrick on my end of the development for input and only had to work closely with Kristoff with his algorithms to be able to make output acceptable for Skip and Josh.\nWhile this was great for the fact that I had less in the form of road-blocks, it also meant that I had some more learning to do.\nI had to gain some understanding as to how the machine learning algorithm worked in order for me to be able to work with it in a more effective manner, something that I will come back to later.</p>\n<p>For the next 8 hours, my job purely consisted of following Google Cloud documentation.\nThis may sound simple when taken from afar, but in practice you do not have enough time to truly read through and learn everything provided.\nIt meant filtering through everything to find points that might be of use, skipping through all the unnecessary parts, and trying to get through these documents as fast as possible.\nUpon completion, the entire of the project would be fed through this computing platform.\nAn insurmountable level of frustration would ensue as following said documentation as intended would result in errors.\nAt most stages during the learning process there would be some error that I would have to resolve before progressing.\nThis meant that the further I progressed, the more past variations of my own I would have to account for and readdress in order to follow along and continue developing the VM's capabilities.</p>\n<p>By 5pm, after a lot of stress and frustration and nothing but breaks to get more coffee and go to the bathroom (in that exact order), my progress was as such:\nI was able to pass the sample images in from a remote location (which for my testing purposes was a Google Cloud Bucket) to the ML Compute Engine provided within the platform.\nAfter the computations were displaying numbers as output instead of errors, I had an moment of relief for myself as everything finally worked as intended.\nMy work was done... I wished.\nI fetched Kristoff to have a look at the lack of errors in my development.\nI had been getting him to review my progress at regular intervals, as I was developing something of which I had no understanding in machine learning.\nHe had reviewed my work multiple times during, but only focused on the errors and gave input as to how I may be able resolve it.\nHe was too enveloped in his own work to review it properly at the time, but this time he looked at the entire thing.\nHe said something along the lines of <em>"No. This is no good. Start again"</em>.\nConfused and upset, I asked him why.\nAfter omitting all the machine learning jargon I couldn't understand, it boiled down to this:\nHis algorithm to handled input differently to Google's ML Compute engine; and although I was just doing what was asked of me, it ended up being 'wrong'.</p>\n<p>With the pressure that the entire project would eventually need a cloud computing platform to piece everything together, I didn\\\\'t have time to be angry or upset at the lost time - I just had to keep going.\nI created a new VM and began reading through more documentation and building the new machine in a more efficient manner, using the knowledge gained from the previous attempt to do it better.</p>\n<p>I got a version from Kristoff of his algorithm to use, which wasn't outputting or even working as intended at that point, but did not result in errors.\nI hosted the algorithm as my own ML engine on the platform for use in development.\nIt was really apparent that my position required someone that understood machine learning to more effectively develop the platform.\nNobody other than Kristoff in the team knew any more than I did of it, so I was still the 'most suitable' person for the job.\nA combination of the lack of sleep from the night before, stress, frustration and pressure remained upon me for the remainder of the event.\nRegardless of all those negative traits, I still really enjoyed the entire experience and will forever fondly remember it.\nThe entire team had been mostly independent - although Skip was the orchestrator behind the idea, we all naturally decided which roles we would take on and carried them out to the best of our abilities.\nI knew it was inevitable but to try and understand more of Kristoff's algorithm in order to create this new VM that would handle everything effectively.\nI took time away from my desk to join him and ask what was going on.</p>\n<p>We were all under a lot of stress, and although Kristoff was hacking away at his code like some genius, he took the time out to explain to me what was going on.\nThe code used Tensorflow and Keras, which to me just looked like Python code - something I had learned a bit about and gradually taught myself in my own time, so I at least had that going for me.\nHe explained the code in multiple levels, slowly toning it down to a point of understanding I had of Python, but I still had no knowledge of how machine learning works, let alone how Tensorflow or Keras functions.\nI listened and interpreted to the utmost best of my abilities for that duration and still left feeling like I didn't understand.\nI had a rough overall idea as to how it worked, but couldn't say I truly knew it.</p>\n<p>As the more time progressed, through the ridiculous levels of caffeine intake and lack of sleep, the quicker time seemed to pass in terms of events I can remember to note.\nOur team slowly took time away to relax and refresh, we relayed our progress but ultimately we droned on with our tasks.\nI kept working away, slowly fixing errors, so many errors; syntax errors, dependency errors, environment errors, so many errors.\nThe combination of errors and lack of sleep resulted in manic laughing fits at moments of despair, but regardless we still droned on with out own levels of stress.</p>\n<p>At around 2am, I encountered an error that seemed so minute in nature but was the arrow to my Achilles heel.\nI had fixed every error other than one; Python versions.\nFor some reason, every image I fed to the ML engine appeared to work in the logs for the first 10 minutes (which is how long I was waiting between changes for confirmation) until I started getting errors.\nGoogling them suggested many different causes.\nI spent a couple hours working through all the different causes until they were all filtered down to the only possible cause, which was a difference in Python versions.\nKristoff (and most of humanity) was using the most current version of Python to develop in his code, which was Python 3, yet all sources seemed to indicate that the Google cloud platform was using Python 2.\n<em>"That's fine, I'll just install the newest version."</em> I thought.\nAfter 10 minutes of computations and receiving the same errors, I google some more and re-implemented.\n10 more minutes, more errors, and more, and more - the story went on.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how many different posts I went through, changes I tried or Gods I prayed to, nothing would change the ML engine to use Python 3 to interpret the code instead of Python 2.\nI was lost.\nThere was nothing more I could do.\nIt was 5am at this point - me and Kristoff decided that once his code was complete, we would use a pre-existing library online that would convert his code from Python 3 to 2.\nIf that worked, we had to hope that the library would work as intended, but my purpose up until that point had ended.\nI kept offering my services to any other members who may need it but ultimately found that I was just twiddling my extremely caffeinated thumbs.\nSometime between 6-8am, the lack of putting that energy to use made my body crash.\nI curled up under a computer desk on a floor and decided to try and sleep my troubles away.</p>\n<p>I hope it was around 6 that I went to sleep, because it was around 9-10am that me and anyone else who slept woke to get some breakfast.\nWe didn't have long to complete our project and submit it all to <a href="https://github.com/stephyx/HackTheSouth" target="_blank">Github</a>/<a href="https://devpost.com/software/lightvision" target="_blank">Devpost</a> by mid-day for submission as well as writing our profiles as to what we did for the event.\nAs I could not upload a multiple gigabyte VM and numerous error-logs for submission, I filled in my profile and continued to try offer other members of the team any help for the little time we had left.\nThe allotted time of constant work was not enough for Kristoff to complete his algorithm for the deadline, which meant mine and Patrick's work ultimately did not get used within the product.\nAlthough the final event for announcing the results was around 3pm in the afternoon, that seemed to arrive within what felt less than half an hour.\nEveryone left the initial building, walking across Southampton University to a lecture theatre as we all waited our turn for the final part of our side of the hackathon; the presentation of our projects.</p>\n<p>As Skip was the origin of the project and is very creative, Skip was one of the members who would present our idea.\nMost of the other teams had every member of their team on stage to present which I felt it was a case of 'Too many chefs in the kitchen'.\nIn the end, me and Skip vouched that very few of us, if more than one should present.\nBy this point Kristoff had left to go home and sleep as he was unhappy with his progress.\nIn the process of leaving so, failed to explain to Skip how his code worked to them.\nSkip could not read through the Github code and understand it, so it came down on me to explain to the best of my ability how his algorithm worked.\nWhen it came to our team's presentation, Skip presented the entire thing independently and confidently, giving our team a great submission for the presentation pitch.</p>\n<p>After all presentations had finished, the judges went away and within half an hour we were all back in the theatre awaiting the results.\nThere were some extremely impressive presentations and submissions we had seen from the other teams and had a tough competition on our hands.\nSitting patiently though all the results the day ended with Skip winning an Apple Watch for the most likes on a picture of themselves on social media.\nTo my absolute surprise, our team won the award for 'Best use of Google Cloud', receiving a Google Home Mini each.\nI am still both speechless and very proud of to this day, regardless of how my progress went.\nLast but not least, our team won third place overall for best submission, medals and a Logitech speaker set each.</p>\n<p>Our team were absolutely amazed at the results and the bond grown between us has been immeasurable, leading in great friendships from a team of students who barely knew each other more than a day before.\nThe skills and experience I gained from my time at the event will never be forgotten and has helped me see how much we can achieve in such little time, leaving me eager to take on more challenges in the years to come.</p>	f	2020-10-17
8	College Music 2013	collegemusic2013	2020-10-22	2012-09-25	2013-10-15	College	A collection of noteworthy moments during my time at college, including producing two pieces of music and performing solo in a gig.	college_music_13	<p>I don't plan on noting down everything I did during the year but that being said, not everything here will just be like a portfolio.\nThese blogs are for me to remember my own experiences more than anything else, so for me to remember so far back in my life (7 years as of writing) is definitely a trip down memory lane.\nIf you're just here to check out what I created, then go down to the Recording Music and Gig sections.</p>\n<h2>Prologue</h2>\n<p>When I originally wanted to go to college, I planned to study Computing and Systems Support.\nAs I spent my teenage years messing around in school and refused to turn up to an English exam on Shakespeare, my grades weren't up to snuff.\nAlthough my technical skills and knowledge were enough to keep up in the classes, the teacher refused to let me in as I had a D in English rather than a C.\nI did everything I could to try and prove I could fit in but despite all my efforts, the man had made up his mind - not even me begging him would change his mind.\nWith my future plans crushed, college seemed like a no-go for me.\nI didn't bother applying for any more courses and walked home a broken boy.</p>\n<p>As soon as I got home, I got on my bike and decided to just cycle in a direction and keep going.\nI wasn't taking the situation very well and my plan was to get very lost - as if that would have helped.\nUnder-dressed and in the rain, I cycled west and kept going for about 2 hours until I found myself blocked as a motorway prevented my path.\nCouldn't get into college, couldn't cycle myself into obscurity, couldn't run away from my problems.\nHit by the literal brick wall that was the surface of an underpass, I had to stop and think about what I was doing with my life.\nI had lots of anti-role models in my life and knew exactly what I didn't want to become, and with those fears in mind I knew that not getting a college degree would make me like them.</p>\n<p>Shivering cold from the wind and rain wasn't so bad as it hid the tears of my own disappointment at the time.\nMostly that disappointment came from myself - from not focusing harder in school (or at the very least turning up for that exam) but that disappointment turned into anger.\nThe anger was aimed at the teacher who refused to let me onto the Computing course.\nLiterally every other member of staff, including those above him, were happy for me to come on so long as he agreed.\nI knew I would have to go back to college and retake my English exam - wasting an entire year just so I could get onto that course and prove that man wrong.\nAn extra year of my life was to be taken prisoner by the education system and as a result of that, I had to chose extra courses alongside my English retake.\nLong story short - they were Sociology, Music Technology and Music Practitioner.\nWhy music? Because I like listening to it and had been playing acoustic guitar since Year 3.\nWhy sociology? Because my friends were in it, of course.</p>\n<h2>Orchestra</h2>\n<p>I wasn't a creative musician before starting college at all.\nI wasn't even a creative musician after leaving college coming to think about it.\nRegardless, to try and open our minds to critique music and experience new sounds, the department did their best to make sure you were cultured during that time.\nWhen I say cultured, I mean by making us experience different lights of life - namely the music side, obviously.\nThe two teachers we had were Geoff; an extremely calm, enthusiastic and passionate man, and Claire; a quiet, humble and caring woman.\nOne of my favourite events of this was attending an orchestra for the first time:</p>\n<p>As a teenager listing to a wide range of music from drum and bass to ska, the idea of going to an orchestra was obviously extremely uncool at the time.\n<em>'Who on earth would want to listen to such boring music?'</em> I thought.\nDespite this mindset, a school trip was still a school trip regardless of if it was after hours or not.\nNaturally I signed up to go along with some friends, because groups of insecure teenagers follow the crowd.\nNamely, the friends I went with were called Sam, Ethan and Carmine.</p>\n<p>The orchestra took place in what I can mostly determine to be <a href="https://www.anvilarts.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Anvil</a>, Basingstoke, as I remember we got off at the train station and was a short walk through the shopping center.\nWe were given a heads-up that attending an orchestra is a very different atmosphere to a normal music gig or venue, but never really told exactly how.\nUpon entering the building, we were given fliers about the event coupled with somewhat discerning looks from the way we were dressed.\nThe flier noted the name of the orchestra (from 20 seconds of digging online, was likely <a href="https://www.bso.org.uk/" target="_blank">Basingstoke Symphony Orchestra</a> but who knows) and noted that there was some special guest as lead or something.\nWe were ushered into the main hall where we were on the right hand stands, above those below us who were directly facing the orchestra, and opposite were the left hand stands at the same height as us.\nSat to the right of me was Ethan, to my left was Carmine, and in the stands opposite to us but directly in my sight were two good looking girls my age.</p>\n<p>On that last note, it must be said that I am short sighted and very rarely wear my glasses.\nAs I often say: <em>'The less I have to pay attention to in this world, the better'</em>, and am mostly fine with seeing life through blurred eyes.\nOn this occasion though, I wish I had brought them as not only could I not see how the girls actually looked but I couldn't see the center stage properly either.\nAfter about 15 minutes, all the guests were seated in the hall.\nEven through my blurry eyes, I could see that despite our college group and the (likely other college) group the girls opposite us, the rest of the audience were all finely dressed elderly people.\nThe orchestra started coming onto the stage and all our college group stood up from our seats and started clapping.\nNobody else in the room followed but instead they all looked at us, confused.\nClaire, who was sat behind us that quietly told us to sit down and that nobody makes a sound until the entire group are onstage - namely the special guest in this case.\nEmbarrassed, we all sat down and waited patiently for the guest to come on stage.</p>\n<p>Like all music events, they seemingly make you wait ages just to piss you off before they start actually doing anything.\nAfter a good 5 minutes of people slowly coming out and getting to their spots, they just sat there and waited silently.\nWe were obviously waiting for that special guest, right?\nWith the build-up she's been given, she must have been like the new Messiah.\nA few more minutes pass and a woman in a dress comes out with an instrument.\nOur college group has been waiting for this moment, patiently.\nWe all rose like cat when they notice their owner has just left their seat and that spot is now up for grabs.\nWe stood, and we slapped, and everybody was silent. Again.\nThis woman was not the Messiah, but a mere mortal just like us who just came on stage late.\nFool us once, shame on us, but fool us twice? Well, we wouldn't be making that mistake again.</p>\n<p>Not too long after, the real guest came out on stage - looking just as much a blur as the last lady to me.\nThe rest of the audience all rose and clapped in some sort of collective consciousness that all orchestra goers obviously have.\nUs, however, no.\nWe were bummed out from before and just left it to the professional clappers.\nI noticed that those girls opposite us were giggling at me, but it seemed in a playful way though.\nEveryone sat down and the lights dimmed as the orchestra began their build up.\nAt first the music was just an overwhelming noise to me - it didn't make much sense as to why people liked it.\nLooking around the venue, I enjoyed the feel though.\nI felt a sense of belonging, being out in the cold, dark night in a city miles away being a part of an experience I had never felt before.\nIt was a new culture I was getting accustomed to.\nI noticed that the songs were very long - like 12 minutes sort of long and they went through many different motions within single songs.\nThe idea ot these motions were entirely new to me as most songs are the same sort of mood and tempo all the way through other than a slight mix up in the bridge/outro.\nI began to get the understanding that the entire concert was more like a journey, it felt like a story of seasons as it transitioned from one to another.\nDespite how much I was secretly enjoying it though, I was still a teenager and those girls kept coming back into my sight.</p>\n<p>I didn't have much self esteem and after many years of bullying for my looks I was almost certain these girls couldn't have been interested in me, right?\nThey were still communicating my way, waving, making faces, etc.\nI wanted to confirm that they were actually talking to me though with my bad vision.\nI looked at Ethan to see if they were doing it to him but no - he was on his phone and chatting with Sam.\nI looked at Carmine and she was seemingly entranced by the music as she was getting comfy leaning forward on the railing to get a better view.\nI waved at them and smiled and sure enough they did the same back!\nThis sparked a little thing that kept going through the entire concert.\nWe would pull funny faces at each other, they blew kisses, and I wouldn't know what to do so I'd just show my awkwardness.\nThe night would entail me going back and forth between listening and paying attention to the orchestra and playing along with these girls</p>\n<p>Come the end of the concert, people started leaving and as we were at the very front row of the right hand stands, we would be the last to be able to leave through that exit.\nThe girls opposite me had got up and started walking away.\nEthan poked my arm and said to me <em>'Did you notice those girls opposite us?'</em> "Yeah" <em>'They were giving me looks and making faces at me all night!'</em>.\nNow Ethan was much better looking and more confident than I was - had better eye-sight too, so obviously I was mistaken and they meant all that stuff to him.\nI was a bit upset but the night was still fun.\nCarmine then came over and said <em>'Oh my god, guys. There were these really hot girls opposite me and they were really into me!'</em>.\nNow I should note that Carmine was a lesbian.\nEthan disputed it, saying that they were obviously looking at him and then I chimed in that I too was mistaken.\nWe laughed a tiny bit but there was clearly a bit of frustration that we didn't know who it was aimed at.</p>\n<p>We eventually were able to get up and leave the room to go back into the entrance hall.\nTo our surprise, the girls were waiting in the hall seemingly looking around but never actually clocked eyes with us.\nNow was our time to discover the truth.\nOne of us just had to go over to the girls and ask who they were actually talking to.\nBoth Carmine and Ethan got cold feet and refused to do it outright.\nI however decided to take a leap of faith and go for it.\nI began walking straight towards them and just as we clocked eyes, I chickened out and headed straight to the men's room.\nI genuinely needed to pee after all that ordeal and all the stalls were taken - my only option was to use the urinal next to an old man who was already there.\nStood next to him, I unzipped and tried to relieve myself but the man just looked right down at it and would not stop watching.\nThis made me extremely uncomfortable and after a good 10 seconds of wishing something would come out, the old man had won.\nI physically could not go, and so he watched me for that time as I did nothing, shook a couple times and went back outside.\nCarmine and Ethan were angry that I chickened out, but I was more angry that I didn't get to pee.\nThe girls had already left by the time I got out and we college students got escorted back to the train by Claire.</p>\n<h2>Quartet</h2>\n<p>The next time I had any real musical cultural exposure was when a trip opportunity arose to attend a quartet in London.\nEnjoying my last experience, I signed up for this one too but do not recall any people I went with.\nWe took a train to London Waterloo and walked up to the London Eye before walking along the riverfront to get to the <a href="https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/" target="_blank">National Theatre</a>.\nBefore this point, I never had a good opinion of London and saw it as a cramped dirty city space.\nUpon actually getting there though, I saw that the place can actually be a thing of beauty in the right spots - here being one of them.\nThe National Theatre itself was a concrete architecture reminiscent to that of tower blocks from what I recall, but still had a unique look to it.</p>\n<p>Inside, the concert room we entered wasn't that large and had maybe about 50 chairs in it aimed towards a stage with some instruments on it.\nBefore this point, I had never even heard of a quartet, nor even considered what sort of music they would play so the entire experience was a complete surprise to me.\nMuch sooner than the wait I had with the orchestra, 4 men came out onto the stage and sat by their instrument as the one behind the microphone gave a brief introduction about themselves.\nThey were <a href="https://lundquartet.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Lund Quartet</a> and appeared to be an experimental group.\nThey played the entirety of their self-titled debut album, consisting of theremins, electronic sounds, remixed vocals to name a few.\nThe songs they played were in no way anything like what I had expected and I was thoroughly enjoying it.</p>\n<p>During the half-way break, Geoff, our teacher, immediately went over to them and was chatting away in admiration like a child in a toy shop.\nThat man was always so incredibly passionate, it was admirable.\nI do not recall anything else of note from this night other than the fact that when we first entered the building it was day.\nBy the time we left, it was night and as such I got to experience the city lights of London for the first time in my life and that once again gave me a sense of belonging for some reason.\nWe followed a different path back to Waterloo station, instead going around the Odeon BFI IMAX which gave exposure to the large backlit advertisement billboards that you don't tend to see where I'm from.\nOn the train ride home, the transition through the cityscapes of night-time London back to home felt like having the ability to experience that finer culture again being sucked from me.</p>\n<h2>Recording music</h2>\n<p>Now I couldn't have taken a music course without having to produce some music, right?\nMaybe then I wouldn't have to put these songs out on the internet.\nI could just not, but regardless of how I feel about these pieces of work, I don't think I should be ashamed of what I ultimately achieved.</p>\n<p>A lot of the year was learning theory of how songs are made, what sounds can do what, and what environments can produce what effects.\nWe did get a lot of hands-on experience, building stage sets, mixing tracks and more but none of that produced anything tangible we could show off.\nOne of our tasks was to produce a song entirely using Apple Logic - so not only did this mean that we had to actually come up with a song but it meant we had to learn the software too.\nI went through multiple iterations of what sort of track I would make but eventually decided I wanted to work on something that would experiment with the layering of different tracks together.</p>\n<p>What I ended up producing below is nothing I am particularly proud of and if you dare to listen, be ready on the volume slider as the audio mixing turned out terrible when it was exported (it sounded so much better before, I swear!).\nThe initial idea was to go with some sort of space theme for the synths, and in the wise words of Bob Marley: <em>'And for what? I don't know'</em>.\nThe ending climax with everything playing at once has no space feel at all and is an absolute mess that is offensive on the ears, but it was my first attempt at this sort of thing so I can't be too harsh on it.</p>\n<audio controls>\n    <source src="../static/media/tech_song.mp3" type="audio/mp3">\n    Your browser does not support the audio tag.\n</audio>\n<hr/>\n<p>The next song we had to produce was to be a physical recording, be it solo vocals, drums, whatever.\nI played acoustic and bass guitar and obviously an entire song of just bass guitar would have been boring so an acoustic track was decided.\nThe song had to be entirely original so a cover song wasn't an option.\nOn top of that, I knew that me just doing one guitar track would be rather dull, so I decided to do more layering of tracks as I did before (but better this time).\nWith that in mind I knew I would have to record myself playing multiple different tracks on guitar and them line up.\nDo you know how hard it is to sit in a recording studio all day (that you had to set up yourself) and play the same songs over and over again to try and keep perfect rhythm?\nAs you'll hear in the song, practically impossible - you'll notice many times where the tracks become slightly out of sync thanks to my feeble human timing skills.</p>\n<p>I still needed some direction for the song, something to make it stand out a little from every other typical douchebag acoustic guitar playing college student out there.\nI took huge inspiration from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRI2u1v4uCM" target="_blank">Bibio - Lover's Carvings</a>, which I think was playing on an Amazon Kindle advert at the time.\nThe song has two different sections to the song, basically changing to a new song halfway through giving the first half somewhat of a build up.\nThat's what I aimed for in this track, so if you can bear the torture long enough try to sit through the entire song.\nI am actually proud of this track as like I stated, I did 100% of it - from the setup to the writing to the playing and the recording.\nRegardless of how many imperfections are in the song, it shows far more creativity than the electronic track before.</p>\n<audio controls>\n    <source src="../static/media/practitioning_song.mp3" type="audio/mp3">\n    Your browser does not support the audio tag.\n</audio>\n<h2>The gig</h2>\n<p>This story has a lot more to it than the previous two songs.\nFor this exam we were expected to perform a live gig - in front of real people! Strangers!\nAt first Geoff and Claire wanted us to play in the atrium of the college during the day which would have been disastrous as nobody would want us there.\nWe would have been blocking their way on their lunch breaks and would be subjected to nasty comments, so thankfully I pressured heavily for it to be moved elsewhere.\nInstead the event was moved to after hours where we hosted a gig for friends, families and anyone with an interest to attend.\nThis was far more favourable to me as those who were attending actually wanted to hear people play and would be much more receptive.</p>\n<p>With that sorted the next thing we had to do was decide what we wanted to do.\nAnything was on the table really - you could sing solo, a duet, play in a band, anything.\nI originally wanted to play in a band so I wouldn't have any focus on myself and could hide away but my friends who had formed a band for this task would prove infeasible.\nTheir band name took inspiration from that such as Blink 182, Sum 41 and Plus 44, and was obviously a punk band.\nTheir name? <em>Plus Enter</em> (as in placenta) so they could get around the ban on having rude and inappropriate names for their band.\nAs you could guess from the style of my previous two songs, I wasn't really the right fit for them.</p>\n<p>With no other people I felt comfortable asking to join, I knew I would have to do this solo and the thought of that terrified me.\nSitting in front of a large audience doing nothing but playing guitar on its own - I knew that would be a dull and boring show.\nAs a result of this I knew I would have to learn how to sing and play guitar at the same time.\nThat had a load of implications on it's own - like being able to even sing for a start, that would have been nice.\nOn top of that, being able to sing and play at the same time was no easy task for me.\nI would either start singing out of tune, or playing out of time - I could never get it right.</p>\n<p>I spent weeks just trying to learn how to sing and play at the same time which set me back a lot.\nNext up I had to decide on the set-list, something that would actually continuously change right up until the final few hours.\nAs I would be singing the songs as well as playing them I had to gauge songs on two metrics; can my voice reach those notes? am I skilled enough to play this on guitar?\nTrying to find songs that fit in between the two was hard enough, and then on top of that you have to think about the flow of your gig too.\nYou can't be playing an acoustic rendition of a Metallica song and immediately transition into a Jimi Hendrix banger - they all need to have fluidity.\nYou also needed to note the artists before and after you for the same reason.\nClearly my musical tastes wouldn't be a good fit to be played right before Plus Enter got on stage and started rocking it out.</p>\n<p>One of the songs I sank a lot of time into learning was an acoustic version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0geNwgAUFo" target="_blank">Bloc Party - This Modern Love</a> but unfortunately could not match Kele's vocal range no matter how hard I tried.\nThere were countless other songs I would constantly shuffle through and ended up learning to play around 7 songs entirely ready for the event.\nI was so nervous about the gig that I could play the entire 7 songs with my eyes closed back to back flawlessly.\nMy family must have got sick of hearing me play and sing the same songs over and over again every day for months.</p>\n<p>We would regularly catch up with our teachers about our progress and Claire would give me feedback on what songs I should focus more on based on how I performed to her.\nI wish I could remember the full list of songs I was playing because originally I was advised to stick with so many songs that I dropped at the last moment.\nI kept sticking with This Modern Love as it really pushed me to my limits, with the vocal range used, how little chance you get for breath between verses and range of guitar skill shown.\nThe fact that my voice was starting to break and lose itself with all of the attempts I tried to match Kele made me realise that I needed songs that could match my boring, monotone voice.</p>\n<p>I can sing deeper songs very well but didn't want to have the entire gig be deep and monotone songs.\nThe gig was entertaining the audience (or at least trying) so I still planned to ensure I had a range of vocal songs in the set list.\nIn the final hours before our list was printed out to give to guests I went with:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AHCfZTRGiI" target="_blank">Johnny Cash - Hurt</a></li>\n    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OONuoEHxlsQ" target="_blank">Gary Jules - Falling Awake</a></li>\n    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcVHbKBtVX0" target="_blank">Cat Power - Naked If I Want To</a></li>\n    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gznDYiDC94" target="_blank">Bon Iver - Beach Baby</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'll talk about that list for a moment.\nOne thing I hate is how when an artist covers a song it is not obvious it is a cover, nor who wrote the original.\nI was entirely unaware that Hurt was a cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty-bLdf8Bsw" target="_blank">Nine Inch Nails</a> nor that Naked If I Want To was a cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b8utHBk3aQ" target="_blank">Moby Grape</a>.\nI stated in the gig that Cat Power covered the song but had no idea who from.\nStill to this day I'm finding songs I like are actually covers and discover the original is better (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPD8Ja64mRU" target="_blank">the original version</a> of José González's more popular cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-liyr-Xq3E" target="_blank">Heartbeats</a>).</p>\n<p>Cutting forward to the night of the gig, us students were upstairs getting ready, practicing and biting our nails.\nNo matter how popular and confident people were before, everyone was very nervous and supporting of each other on this night.\nThe time had come for us to go down and setup the stage.\n2nd year students were called in to do the sound mixing for us and so we had to do little practice vocals on stage before-hand to have them get our levels right - not that it would be the same as when we actually sang.\nEventually people started to show up.\nThose who I had invited that night showed just how much of a typical douchebag acoustic guitar playing college student I was:\nMy girlfriend at the time, two love interests and the gig was also being recorded for another one.\nOther than the love interests, I also had 2 other female friends attend.\nLooking back on the footage now, I'm amazed I wasn't so embarrassed I couldn't show my face to them again.</p>\n<p>Remember how I said I could play my entire set list back to back with my eyes closed flawlessly?\nNerves throw all that out the window.\nAnother thing that messes things up is not drinking water before you sing, nor bringing any with you.\nMy voice that night was already croaky from my nerves but on top of that the dryness didn't help any.\nI remember being able to sing the songs shown far better than performed but you'll get to judge how the gig went for yourselves.\nI should say before you start that another guy called James played immediately before me.</p>\n<video width="720" height="576" controls>\n    <source src="../static/media/james_whale.mp4" type="video/mp4">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n<h3>Hurt</h3>\n<p>In the first song, it sounds like I am trying to play percussion on the guitar by hitting it - that was my nerves.\nAlso for Hurt, my performance was extremely nervous as you have no reaction from the crowd and as such have absolutely no idea how you're doing.\nYou'll notice that Geoff is crouched down hiding in the video.\nI have no idea why he was doing this other than to stop me if I tried to jump off the stage to my death if things went too bad.\nThings were indeed going bad in the song too.\nI couldn't hit some of the lower notes with my voice and kept messing up certain chords.\nSurprisingly though I didn't let this stop me and kept going on regardless.</p>\n<h3>Falling Awake</h3>\n<p>After I heard the applaud from the crowd after the first song and Geoff decided he wasn't on suicide watch, I felt a lot more relaxed.\nYou'll hear someone from the crowd say 'James on the bass!' - this was a joke about how I was jokingly seen as some sort of bass-playing legend despite nobody ever really having heard me play it.\nDuring Falling Awake, I noticed my phone was causing interference with the speakers but tried to fight that distraction as best I could.\nDespite having more confidence in this song, my voice was still very dry and did not like trying to put much variation into the cut-offs for words.\nThe rest of the song went mostly well and the applaud saved me from having a nervous breakdown from how many things I felt was going wrong.</p>\n<h3>Naked If I Want To</h3>\n<p>As I wanted to give people a tiny bit of energy before my next song as I knew my setlist was planned to be very mellow, I tried my best to put some more energy to my vocals in this one.\nI made very few mistakes with the guitar chords but the chatter in the crowd started making me feel like I was doing bad and was boring them.\nYou'll notice one bit where I almost stop the song completely with a mess up from the nerves and start hitting the guitar again.\nThe power of the crowd really influenced my performance and if only I had known that that noise from the crowd was actually mostly two girls, that would have helped me so much.</p>\n<h3>Beach Baby</h3>\n<p>With myself still feeling like I was boring the crowd, this last song was played a lot faster than it was supposed to be as I just wanted to get the gig over with and jump off the stage to my death.\nAs a result of this, there was very little effort put into the vocals and made a few guitar slip ups.\nThe song was intended to be the warm-feeling slower song to end off the gig and mellow it all out for the next person.\nInstead what was given was a rushed version of a very tricky song to play (which I still played extremely well regardless).\nAfter I quickly thanked the crowd when the song ended, you can catch a freeze frame of me proving to Geoff that he should have stayed ready all along.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Despite how differently I performed compared to how I was without a crowd, I will forever be extremely proud of what I achieved.\nI didn't flake out on the night like many did.\nI didn't hide behind others by joining a band or having someone else be in the center of the stage when the gig was about them.\nI pushed myself to the limit learning how to sing and play and fight the fear of playing in front of a crowd.\nThis gig is to thank for me not having the fear of standing up on stage today and presenting an awful idea to hundreds at hackathons.\nIt's this gig I have to thank for learning that if you try to juggle round multiple girls at once, you're going to have a bad time.\nFinally, its this gig that has made me happy that I messed up in school, that I ran away from my problems when I didn't get into college.\nI'm happy about that because it showed that no matter how deep I got myself into a bad situation in life, I'll always find myself in A Better Place, A Better Time.</p>\n<h2>Music - 2nd year</h2>\n<p>I never got my music degree, despite getting all Distinction *'s from my first year.\nI got my C in English (despite refusing again to turn up for the Shakespeare exam - take that, William), and despite working at a B level in Sociology, I ended up with an E as my focus was elsewhere.\nSo why didn't I get my degree?</p>\n<p>With the relevant grades, in my second year I took on Computing, Systems Support and Music Technology.\nAll through my life I've suffered with chronic insomnia, and back then it was extremely bad to the point where I was awake for 3 days straight once.\nRegardless of this, nobody ever seemed to acknowledge it and always brushed it off to me 'playing video games all night' and that was it.\nWhen I got my schedule through for 2nd year, Computing was very intensive - having lots of 9am classes and were scattered all over the week.\nBefore the college had even started I knew I would not be able to take Computing along with the other 2 classes as I would be too zonked out to even pay attention.\nSo with an extremely conflicted heart I walked into the college and dropped the course before it had even started.\nI walked into the Computing teacher who originally rejected me's office and told him with such hatred.\nThat man had rejected me in a year of my life when I could have done it and now my body had deteriorated too far - he screwed me over yet again.</p>\n<p>So with only Systems Support and Music left, things would be okay, right?\nWell when we returned to college, we were informed that Geoff had just up and left for another country without notice and Claire had also decided to leave.\nWe were in a course with 0 teachers to teach us.\nThe college scrambled to find us a replacement and the best they could find was a Drama teacher, turned English teacher who also played guitar - so he's perfect right?\nPlays guitar = fully qualified passionate music teacher.\nI had experienced what music SHOULD have been like with Geoff and Claire and they were both gone now.\nWe were left with a man that had us reading from a text book.\nZero heart, zero passion.\nI dropped the course.</p>\n<p>All I had left was Systems Support, which would have been my foot in the door for the IT industry.\nAlthough I was doing well by keeping up with the coursework and turning up when I could, I kept getting warned that my attendance was an issue.\nI informed the college that it was my insomnia and I couldn't help it.\nOne day I was called into the college and a worker informed me that if I didn't get my attendance up soon, I would be kicked out.\nI was so sick and tired of people refusing to acknowledge my struggles and told them that I was dropping out of college there and then.\nThe man tried to talk me out of it and to 'just make sure you're coming in' but I had made up my mind and stuck with it.\nThis may seem like a bad end to this story, but if I had never dropped out of college I wouldn't be where I am now.</p>	f	2020-10-24
