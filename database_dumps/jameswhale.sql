2	Open Day March 2019	opendaymarch2019	2020-05-02	2019-03-06	2019-03-06	University event	The first time I've worked during a Solent Open Day representing the Computing departm\nent and presenting my experience as a student so far.	open_day_march_19	<p>\\\\r\\\\nOften when people think about events being hosted, they never think about the people who actually host said events.\\\\r\\\\nIf\n they do there\\\\'s an image that there\\\\'s always a huge pool of people just waiting to take up the opportunity.\\\\r\\\\nIn reality, when you learn how life really is, you find that very few people actually take the o\npportunities there are out there.\\\\r\\\\nI used to be one of those people, I used to be a lot of a person, yet I\\\\'m even more of one now.\\\\r\\\\nAfter hearing that there are opportunities to be paid by the university\nto talk about your experience during open days, my initial thought was <em>\\\\'Easy money!\\\\'</em>.\\\\r\\\\nI applied for the role, expecting to hear that there was already a huge line of better suited people waiting b\nefore me, yet I got accepted for the job.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nPrior to the event, I knew that I would have to man a desk, answer any questions about the course and give a presentation about my experience so far\n.\\\\r\\\\nThe latter part required I create a presentation that would be interesting to others, which was the hardest part.\\\\r\\\\nHow do you take your academic life and turn it into something interesting to others?\\\\r\\\n\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nThankfully for me, I have been taking on a multitude of different activities and opportunities since joining and had a lot to talk about.\\\\r\\\\nWhen it came to putting that into the presentation\n, it\\\\'s hard to not make it look boring, especially if you don\\\\'t have images to back it up - something re-enforced during my time creating this website.\\\\r\\\\nIn the weeks before the event, I had time to iterate\nthrough multiple versions of the presentation and came up with a script as if the entire thing would be some sort of play.\\\\r\\\\nAs I\\\\'m sure a lot of people relate to, we barely ever follow the script.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\\nr\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nOn the day, I arrive on time and head to my allotted area where I have to man a desk and answer any queries potential future student may have at me.\\\\r\\\\nI\\\\'m sure a lot of people in computing can rel\nate to the fact we were located down in the basement level.\\\\r\\\\nNormally I find it hard to fake a smile, but when you when you take time out your daily life to help other people a smile comes naturally.\\\\r\\\\nPaire\nd with fellow computing students (of which many of us were friends), we kept at our stations until mid-day, greeting and helping visitors when needed while having fun between us during gaps.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\\nnAfter mid-day, we hosted a mini event within the computing event for those who wish to come where the lecturers spoke about what future students can expect from the university.\\\\r\\\\nThis was followed by talks from\n current students about our experience thus far.\\\\r\\\\nOther than a gig I had to do for my Music course in college many years before, I have never done anything that regards facing the public, presenting to a group\nof strangers was a very new thing to me.\\\\r\\\\nIn my mind I had an entire script to follow word for word to get through the day.\\\\r\\\\nWhen I went up there and got into the flow of things, I found that it\\\\'s a lot m\nore natural if you speak from your heart with what comes on the spot, regardless of if what you wrote before was just as meaningful.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nFor the next 10 minutes, I gave my journey: starting from\n a mature student unsure if he\\\\'s ready to get back into education, all the way up to now, taking on every opportunity I can and never looking back.\\\\r\\\\nI\\\\'m sure to some, the entire thing looked like I had a pr\ne-defined script written by the university that I was paid to follow.\\\\r\\\\nFor me it was a joy to let out in words what it is you\\\\'ve achieved and how much you\\\\'ve grown in such little time.\\\\r\\\\nWhat was even mo\nre gratifying was having individuals approaching me, impressed and inspired about what I said; letting me know that even something as little as just helping yourself can still help others inadvertently.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\\nr\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nAfter the event had ended, our group as friends went out for a fun evening together, enjoying each other\\\\'s company and creating fond memories.\\\\r\\\\nThis was something that became a tradition for our\ngroup at many more events to come.\\\\r\\\\nOverall, I learned a lot from my time attending as it got me to think about how my actions have been influenced by those around me.\\\\r\\\\nIt made me think about how my actions\n could influence those to come and makes me look forward for the further Open Days to come.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n	f
1	Hack the South 2019	hackthesouth2019	2020-05-01	2019-02-09	2019-02-10	Hackathaon	My first hackathon where our team, LightVision, developed a web application which reads out pr\nesented objects to the visually-impaired, winning third place and the Best Use of Google Cloud awards.	hack_south_19	<p>Originally pitched to me as nothing more than the sentence <em>'Join my team.'</em> from\na friend, the idea of a hackathon was entirely new to me.\\nWith it containing the word \\\\'Hack\\\\' and me being a cyber security student, a completely different event was in mind.\\\\r\\\\nAfter looking up the web page\nfor <a href=\\\\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hack-the-south-2019-tickets-52945203529#\\\\" target=\\\\"_blank\\\\">Hack the South 2019</a>, I was convinced that my current skills as a security student would be of no use t\no a team in a hackathon.\\\\r\\\\nRegardless, I was still asked to join anyway and decided to come along to see what I do to help the team.\\\\r\\\\nThe members forming the team was still unclear to me other than the one w\nho asked me.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nIt was both a blessing and a curse that I was invited to a night out at a friend\\\\'s birthday party the night before.\\\\r\\\\nA blessing because they lived near Southampton Univers\nity (where Hack the South was hosted) and offered for me to sleep on the couch, and a curse for reasons you can imagine.\\\\r\\\\nRestlessly, I left the house at 8am the following morning with less than 4 hours sleep.\\\n\\r\\\\nThe walk to the university was a nice way to wake up and let my imagination run loose as to what the weekend would hold for me, of which no scenario in my mind ever came close to the reality.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p\n>\\\\r\\\\nI arrived on-site for 9am and meet with Skip, the friend who invited me onto their team.\\\\r\\\\nWe were left waiting in hope that the other members that were into the team would arrive before the event started\n.\\\\r\\\\nAll but one would arrive within the hour and all of which were members from within the Solent University computing department.\\\\r\\\\nBy 1pm (typical for a group of students) the final member of our team woke\nup and arrived at the event ASAP.\\\\r\\\\nOur team was complete with 5 members; Skip Barden, Kristoff Holthaus, Patrick West, Josh Arrowsmith and myself.\\\\r\\\\nSkip, whose idea we created for the event, was adamant tha\nt they wanted to created something \\\\"Tech for Good\\\\", meaning that the product had to help humanity.\\\\r\\\\nThey wanted us to create an app that would use the camera on the user\\\\'s device to point at an object and\n read out what the object was.\\\\r\\\\nThe project was intended for the visually impaired and anyone else who could benefit from it.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nWith the team assembled and the plan in place, the question\ncame as to which roles everyone had.\\\\r\\\\nSkip studied a web development course and is very artistic, so Skip worked on the website, art and presentation for the app, while integrating an existing fallback computer\n vision algorithm.\\\\r\\\\nKristoff, who is experienced in machine learning, began work on creating a custom algorithm that would provide far better accuracy and reliability for the app once completed.\\\\r\\\\nPatrick us\ned a Raspberry Pi and Pi-Camera, creating a program that would take images, reformat them as required and send them to the algorithm.\\\\r\\\\nJosh assisted Skip in creating the website for the application while Skip w\norked on other areas as needed.\\\\r\\\\nFinally, I took on the role learning how to use a cloud computing platform which ended up being a far bigger task than I imagined.\\\\r\\\\nIt had to take in the images from Patrick\n\\\\'s program, feed that into Kristoff\\\\'s machine learning algorithm for processing, then pass the completed information through to Skip and Josh\\\\'s web application to provide to the user.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\n\nI had very little knowledge of cloud computing from before, but what I did have was an extensive background in using Linux systems.\\\\r\\\\nMy initial idea was to use the IBM Cloud and NodeRED as I had learned a bit a\nbout the platform from attending an IBM Workshop previously.\\\\r\\\\nI began to dig through the platform and looking at all the nodes that could benefit us in our development.\\\\r\\\\nOne of the awards during Hack the So\nuth was for the \\\\'Best use of Google Cloud\\\\', so we instead decided to go with that to be in the running for the prize.\\\\r\\\\nWith little knowledge of cloud computing and none using Google Cloud, the rest of my ti\nme at the event would mainly be reading through documentation.\\\\r\\\\nThis entailed building the virtual machines required (which thankfully were Linux VM\\\\'s!) and working out the endless amount of errors.\\\\r\\\\nMost\n errors came from the fact that I had to deviate from the documentation to try suit our needs, requiring more and more adaptations as time went on.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nTo remove as many bottlenecks as I could f\nrom my workflow, I gathered sample images of objects that were in the format that Kristoff\\\\'s algorithm expected.\\\\r\\\\nThis eliminated the need of any input from Patrick on my end of the development for input and\nonly had to work closely with Kristoff with his algorithms to be able to make output acceptable for Skip and Josh.\\\\r\\\\nWhile this was great for the fact that I had less in the form of road-blocks, it also meant th\nat I had some more learning to do.\\\\r\\\\nI had to gain some understanding as to how the machine learning algorithm worked in order for me to be able to work with it in a more effective manner, something that I will\ncome back to later.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nFor the next 8 hours, my job purely consisted of following Google Cloud documentation.\\\\r\\\\nThis may sound simple when taken from afar, but in practice you do not have en\nough time to truly read through and learn everything provided.\\\\r\\\\nIt meant filtering through everything to find points that might be of use, skipping through all the unnecessary parts, and trying to get through t\nhese documents as fast as possible.\\\\r\\\\nUpon completion, the entire of the project would be fed through this computing platform.\\\\r\\\\nAn insurmountable level of frustration would ensue as following said documentat\nion as intended would result in errors.\\\\r\\\\nAt most stages during the learning process there would be some error that I would have to resolve before progressing.\\\\r\\\\nThis meant that the further I progressed, the\nmore past variations of my own I would have to account for and readdress in order to follow along and continue developing the VM\\\\'s capabilities.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nBy 5pm, after a lot of stress and frustrati\non and nothing but breaks to get more coffee and go to the bathroom (in that exact order), my progress was as such:\\\\r\\\\nI was able to pass the sample images in from a remote location (which for my testing purposes\n was a Google Cloud Bucket) to the ML Compute Engine provided within the platform.\\\\r\\\\nAfter the computations were displaying numbers as output instead of errors, I had an moment of relief for myself as everything\n finally worked as intended.\\\\r\\\\nMy work was done... I wished.\\\\r\\\\nI fetched Kristoff to have a look at the lack of errors in my development.\\\\r\\\\nI had been getting him to review my progress at regular intervals\n, as I was developing something of which I had no understanding in machine learning.\\\\r\\\\nHe had reviewed my work multiple times during, but only focused on the errors and gave input as to how I may be able resolve\n it.\\\\r\\\\nHe was too enveloped in his own work to review it properly at the time, but this time he looked at the entire thing.\\\\r\\\\nHe said something along the lines of <em>\\\\"No. This is no good. Start again\\\\"</e\nm>.\\\\r\\\\nConfused and upset, I asked him why.\\\\r\\\\nAfter omitting all the machine learning jargon I couldn\\\\'t understand, it boiled down to this:\\\\r\\\\nHis algorithm to handled input differently to Google\\\\'s ML Co\nmpute engine; and although I was just doing what was asked of me, it ended up being \\\\'wrong\\\\'.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nWith the pressure that the entire project would eventually need a cloud computing platform to\n piece everything together, I didn\\\\'t have time to be angry or upset at the lost time - I just had to keep going.\\\\r\\\\nI created a new VM and began reading through more documentation and building the new machine i\nn a more efficient manner, using the knowledge gained from the previous attempt to do it better.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nI got a version from Kristoff of his algorithm to use, which wasn\\\\'t outputting or even work\ning as intended at that point, but did not result in errors.\\\\r\\\\nI hosted the algorithm as my own ML engine on the platform for use in development.\\\\r\\\\nIt was really apparent that my position required someone tha\nt understood machine learning to more effectively develop the platform.\\\\r\\\\nNobody other than Kristoff in the team knew any more than I did of it, so I was still the \\\\'most suitable\\\\' person for the job.\\\\r\\\\nA\ncombination of the lack of sleep from the night before, stress, frustration and pressure remained upon me for the remainder of the event.\\\\r\\\\nRegardless of all those negative traits, I still really enjoyed the ent\nire experience and will forever fondly remember it.\\\\r\\\\nThe entire team had been mostly independent - although Skip was the orchestrator behind the idea, we all naturally decided which roles we would take on and c\narried them out to the best of our abilities.\\\\r\\\\nI knew it was inevitable but to try and understand more of Kristoff\\\\'s algorithm in order to create this new VM that would handle everything effectively.\\\\r\\\\nI t\nook time away from my desk to join him and ask what was going on.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nWe were all under a lot of stress, and although Kristoff was hacking away at his code like some genius, he took the time out\n to explain to me what was going on.\\\\r\\\\nThe code used Tensorflow and Keras, which to me just looked like Python code - something I had learned a bit about and gradually taught myself in my own time, so I at least\n had that going for me.\\\\r\\\\nHe explained the code in multiple levels, slowly toning it down to a point of understanding I had of Python, but I still had no knowledge of how machine learning works, let alone how Te\nnsorflow or Keras functions.\\\\r\\\\nI listened and interpreted to the utmost best of my abilities for that duration and still left feeling like I didn\\\\'t understand.\\\\r\\\\nI had a rough overall idea as to how it work\ned, but couldn\\\\'t say I truly knew it.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nAs the more time progressed, through the ridiculous levels of caffeine intake and lack of sleep, the quicker time seemed to pass in terms of events I\ncan remember to note.\\\\r\\\\nOur team slowly took time away to relax and refresh, we relayed our progress but ultimately we droned on with our tasks.\\\\r\\\\nI kept working away, slowly fixing errors, so many errors; sy\nntax errors, dependency errors, environment errors, so many errors.\\\\r\\\\nThe combination of errors and lack of sleep resulted in manic laughing fits at moments of despair, but regardless we still droned on with out\n own levels of stress.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nAt around 2am, I encountered an error that seemed so minute in nature but was the arrow to my Achilles heel.\\\\r\\\\nI had fixed every error other than one; Python versio\nns.\\\\r\\\\nFor some reason, every image I fed to the ML engine appeared to work in the logs for the first 10 minutes (which is how long I was waiting between changes for confirmation) until I started getting errors.\\\n\\r\\\\nGoogling them suggested many different causes.\\\\r\\\\nI spent a couple hours working through all the different causes until they were all filtered down to the only possible cause, which was a difference in Pytho\nn versions.\\\\r\\\\nKristoff (and most of humanity) was using the most current version of Python to develop in his code, which was Python 3, yet all sources seemed to indicate that the Google cloud platform was using\nPython 2.\\\\r\\\\n<em>\\\\"That\\\\'s fine, I\\\\'ll just install the newest version.\\\\"</em> I thought.\\\\r\\\\nAfter 10 minutes of computations and receiving the same errors, I google some more and re-implemented.\\\\r\\\\n10 mo\nre minutes, more errors, and more, and more - the story went on.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nRegardless of how many different posts I went through, changes I tried or Gods I prayed to, nothing would change the ML engin\ne to use Python 3 to interpret the code instead of Python 2.\\\\r\\\\nI was lost.\\\\r\\\\nThere was nothing more I could do.\\\\r\\\\nIt was 5am at this point - me and Kristoff decided that once his code was complete, we woul\nd use a pre-existing library online that would convert his code from Python 3 to 2.\\\\r\\\\nIf that worked, we had to hope that the library would work as intended, but my purpose up until that point had ended.\\\\r\\\\nI\nkept offering my services to any other members who may need it but ultimately found that I was just twiddling my extremely caffeinated thumbs.\\\\r\\\\nSometime between 6-8am, the lack of putting that energy to use mad\ne my body crash.\\\\r\\\\nI curled up under a computer desk on a floor and decided to try and sleep my troubles away.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nI hope it was around 6 that I went to sleep, because it was around 9-10am th\nat me and anyone else who slept woke to get some breakfast.\\\\r\\\\nWe didn\\\\'t have long to complete our project and submit it all to <a href=\\\\"https://github.com/stephyx/HackTheSouth\\\\" target=\\\\"_blank\\\\">Github</\na>/<a href=\\\\"https://devpost.com/software/lightvision\\\\" target=\\\\"_blank\\\\">Devpost</a> by mid-day for submission as well as writing our profiles as to what we did for the event.\\\\r\\\\nAs I could not upload a mult\niple gigabyte VM and numerous error-logs for submission, I filled in my profile and continued to try offer other members of the team any help for the little time we had left.\\\\r\\\\nThe allotted time of constant work\n was not enough for Kristoff to complete his algorithm for the deadline, which meant mine and Patrick\\\\'s work ultimately did not get used within the product.\\\\r\\\\nAlthough the final event for announcing the result\ns was around 3pm in the afternoon, that seemed to arrive within what felt less than half an hour.\\\\r\\\\nEveryone left the initial building, walking across Southampton University to a lecture theatre as we all waited\n our turn for the final part of our side of the hackathon; the presentation of our projects.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nAs Skip was the origin of the project and is very creative, Skip was one of the members who would\n present our idea.\\\\r\\\\nMost of the other teams had every member of their team on stage to present which I felt it was a case of \\\\'Too many chefs in the kitchen\\\\'.\\\\r\\\\nIn the end, me and Skip vouched that very f\new of us, if more than one should present.\\\\r\\\\nBy this point Kristoff had left to go home and sleep as he was unhappy with his progress.\\\\r\\\\nIn the process of leaving so, failed to explain to Skip how his code wo\nrked to them.\\\\r\\\\nSkip could not read through the Github code and understand it, so it came down on me to explain to the best of my ability how his algorithm worked.\\\\r\\\\nWhen it came to our team\\\\'s presentation,\n Skip presented the entire thing independently and confidently, giving our team a great submission for the presentation pitch.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nAfter all presentations had finished, the judges went away and\nwithin half an hour we were all back in the theatre awaiting the results.\\\\r\\\\nThere were some extremely impressive presentations and submissions we had seen from the other teams and had a tough competition on our\nhands.\\\\r\\\\nSitting patiently though all the results the day ended with Skip winning an Apple Watch for the most likes on a picture of themselves on social media.\\\\r\\\\nTo my absolute surprise, our team won the awar\nd for \\\\'Best use of Google Cloud\\\\', receiving a Google Home Mini each.\\\\r\\\\nI am still both speechless and very proud of to this day, regardless of how my progress went.\\\\r\\\\nLast but not least, our team won thir\nd place overall for best submission, medals and a Logitech speaker set each.\\\\r\\\\n</p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>\\\\r\\\\nOur team were absolutely amazed at the results and the bond grown between us has been immeasurable, leading in gr\neat friendships from a team of students who barely knew each other more than a day before.\\\\r\\\\nThe skills and experience I gained from my time at the event will never be forgotten and has helped me see how much we\n can achieve in such little time, leaving me eager to take on more challenges in the years to come.\\\\r\\\\n</p>	f
3	Fire Hack 2019	firehack2019	2020-05-03	2019-03-29	2019-03-31	Hackathon	This hackathon entailed developing solutions to command and control simulated UAVs to detect and map out wildfires in a\n joint event between UK and US teams, where our team, Promise, came second and won the Innovation award.	fire_hack_19	During \\'Hack the South 2019\\' a month prior we were all given cards promoting <a href=\\"h\nttps://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/2019-fire-hack-registration-53590796515#\\">Fire Hack 2019</a>, an upcoming hackathon the following month.\\r\\nThe event was looking for teams of 4-8 people in a 3 day event with challen\nges increasing in complexity.\\r\\nTeams were required to design and implement algorithms to command and control UAVs to search and map for simulated wildfires.\\r\\nIn the weeks following Hack the South, the event wou\nld also be advertised by the computing department at Solent University and teams were being formed of those wanting to join the event.\\r\\nI joined a balanced team of people when it came to skill and knew all the me\nmbers well, including Skip, one of the same members I was with during Hack the South.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOnce all the students who wanted the attended the event had signed up, it resulted in two teams, each lead by\na lecturer from the Computing department.\\r\\nOur team leader was Prins Butt, a programming lecturer and along with him the team consisted of Skip Barden (web developer), James Richardson (software engineer), Aaron\nJenkins (software engineer), Denise Tineghe (business information technology), Tobiasz Kaduk (computing) and myself.\\r\\nBetween us we covered a wide area of expertise and Prins had plans for us all.\\r\\nHe, James an\nd Aaron would be the coding force behind the project while the rest of us would break each scenario down into separate modules and theorise algorithms as to how each one could be solved through code.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\n\\r\\nWith the teams created, we had a month to sign the legal contract, download the simulation software and practice by completing and submitting Challenge 0 before the event started.\\r\\nTo make this more fun, we h\nad a little rivalry between both Solent teams and was jokingly secretive between us from the start as we made plans to meet up at regular times prior to the event and get ahead of the other team.\\r\\nWe were a big t\neam, so finding a time that we were all free and could meet up to practice was hard, but we were also university students that wanted to have fun when we did meet up, which was even harder.\\r\\nBy the time the event\n came around, we had barely all got the simulation software installed on our laptops, let alone completed the challenge so we had no preparation done before-hand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDays before the event, one of our\n team members (unnamed) dropped out for personal reasons, leaving our team a man down for the hackathon.\\r\\nMiscellaneous challenges were in place for attendees to win Raspberry Pi 3b+\\'s during the event.\\r\\n50 we\nre won by the first people who submitted Challenge 0 (which we did not), so we wanted to win at least something during our time there.\\r\\nAdditionally, the first 25 people to arrive on the day would also receive on\ne, so our team all agreed to meet up before the event and each win our Pi\\'s.\\r\\nWhile waiting in line, a man in his 40\\'s-50\\'s was walking around the groups and introducing himself.\\r\\nHe said hello to us and was\n very friendly; his name was Justin.\\r\\nJustin came from London just to attend the event but didn\\'t have a team.\\r\\nThis was convenient for us as we were a man down and offered him a place as we got to know more a\nbout him.\\r\\nHe had a background in many different areas in computing but wanted to join the coders in the development of the software.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe rest of the first day entailed the event organisers intr\noducing everyone and helping people set up.\\r\\nOur team found a table and got to work breaking down Scenario 1, deciding what searching pattern we would begin coding for our initial algorithm.\\r\\nWe spent many hour\ns jotting down any possible patterns we could think of, silly or not, then slowly filtering through all the possibilities until we were left with a set of search patterns that were all robust in their own ways.\\r\\n\nMost of the other teams defaulted to a spiral search pattern, slowly spiralling into the centre of the map.\\r\\nWhile this was a good way to search the map with just one UAV, we wanted our pattern to be a single pat\ntern that could be multiplied to facilitate for any number of UAVs we had at our disposal.\\r\\nTo prevent this blog being a magnitude larger than it already is, I will omit the research stage of this and tell you th\nat our final algorithm functioned closely to the <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Hilbert Curve</a> (of which we took no inspiration from when designing it).\\r\\nOur pattern\nwas slightly different, only using right turns to ensure that everything would always be relative to clockwise-directions.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy this point, it was 10pm and the building was closing for the night.\\r\\\nnWe all decided to go out and have some fun in the town with Justin.\\r\\nI was driving and only joined in with the junk food.\\r\\nWe got lots of pizzas and went back to Justin\\'s hotel room where we continued to do s\nome light work and have fun until about 2am where I drove home to sleep.\\r\\nThe building opened again at 8:30am the following morning but I was so tired from the day before that I slept in and arrived at around 11\ninstead.\\r\\nEveryone was there but Justin, working hard as we had until 2pm to submit Challenge 1 before the next challenge was released.\\r\\nHaving only just deciding on what pattern we wanted, we were nowhere near\n close to even having a working client.\\r\\nThe trade-off was worth it as we had everyone on the same level, agreeing what we had was something that could work in multiple situations.\\r\\nThe coders continued their c\nhallenge of putting our design into lines of code that could be used in an object-oriented manner.\\r\\nThe think-tank worked out solutions to how the drones would be allocated to different paths and what they should\n do once they detect a fire.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe rest of my day would entail myself going through multiple different designs and ideas, critiquing every one with a high level of scrutiny.\\r\\nMy fellow teams membe\nrs would verify to ensure that any designs that did pass through different stages had been poked and prodded as many was we could to see how it would fit alongside our current algorithm that was in development.\\r\\n\nWe didn\\'t have anything to submit for both Challenge 1 and 2 that day, meaning our last chance was for Challenge 3 the next day.\\r\\nInstead of going out to have fun again later that night, we went to the universit\ny library which was open 24/7 for the event and continued our work until the late hours of the morning.\\r\\nOne by one, members of the team got too tired and left to go home to bed until all who remained were myself\n, Prins and James.\\r\\nWe still did not have a fully functioning version of the search algorithm yet.\\r\\nI assisted the coders by suggesting different ways we could handle the code from my understanding as to how al\nl our algorithms were theorised.\\r\\nThe lack of preparation before the event, paired with how much background calculations we had to do in order to achieve simple tasks was proving to hold back the coding side pret\nty bad.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe algorithm would determine the width and length of the given map as well as a centre point that was a latitude/longitude co-ordinates.\\r\\nThose numbers would allow us to automatically g\nather latitude/longitude coordinates from any point in the map that we required on the fly, but it is a lot easier to explain than it was so code.\\r\\nWe kept working until around 5:30am, where we were so exhausted\nand frustrated that the manic laughing I experienced at the last hackathon was occurring to my members around me, spreading like a contagious disease.\\r\\nI got some fresh air to wake up and insisted to drive Prins\nhome, returning to the Library to continue working with James on trying to get the code working.\\r\\nWe tried our best to keep fighting through it but the exhaustion hit me again shortly after I began reading throug\nh the API and code once more.\\r\\nWhat I had planned to be closing my eyes for 10 minutes resulted in me falling asleep on the table until 8:30am, where I noticed James passed out also.\\r\\nWe got our stuff and moved\n over to the main building to get some breakfast and try continue work but shortly passed out again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSome time later we were woke by Prins, who made his way back in and was ready to fight the code\n with a (somehow) rested mind.\\r\\nSlowly, all but Justin still would arrive and continue working on required areas.\\r\\nThe final submission had to be in by noon and we still didn\\'t have our code working.\\r\\nSkip h\nad also been working on an app idea over the days that could be used to assist the services in locating the fires alongside working on presentation slides for our project.\\r\\nThe three coders were back at it and ge\ntting a working version so close to completion.\\r\\nI kept assisting them in debating how the code should work, as well as developing methods the UAVs could use to map out the fires.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith less than\n half an hour to spare, we got the code working - and it worked gloriously.\\r\\nAll that time spent ignoring the other submissions was worth it.\\r\\nWhat we had was something so robust that it would work across every\n scenario without a hitch.\\r\\nThe code was working, Skip completed the app design, we all filled out the necessary forms and created a presentation to sell our team\\'s work.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe judges came round\nto every team one by one and gave a chance for the team to present themselves.\\r\\nWe left our presentation to Prins and Skip to give to ensure it wasn\\'t too crowded.\\r\\nThe research shown that was put into the des\nign of the algorithm, the dedication we shown to get it working and the confidence we showed in its complexity, paired with the data input we could get from the app idea proved to be a very strong selling point.\\r\\\nnAs all the teams were thanked for their efforts in the event our team was not included, which was a good sign.\\r\\nOur team was called up on stage and given the Innovation award, for thinking outside the box with o\nur app and how different our search algorithm was from everyone else\\'s.\\r\\nWe were also informed that we were very closely considered as first place but ultimately had to be given second, but something we were all\n extremely proud of none-the-less.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWe did not go to the event hell-bent on winning; we just arrived wanting to learn new things and have fun - and that\\'s what we did but just so happened to win p\nrizes at the same time, which is always a plus.\\r\\nIf I could go back and do it again, I would have made it so that both teams from the university did Challenge 0 together to ensure we were all prepared before the\nevent started, but the event was still an invaluable experience.\\r\\n</p>	f
4	Open Day April 2019	opendayapril2019	2020-05-04	2019-04-09	2019-04-09	University event	This article logs my second Open Day, allowing me to improve my performance from the experience gained f\nrom the prior event.	open_day_april_19	<p>\\r\\nAfter working at the last Open Day, I felt a lot more confident about working more of the events.\\r\\nThis time was a lot easier as I already had my presentation c\nreated from the last time.\\r\\nThe schedule was the same as always - 9:30 start, manning the computing desk and greeting any visitors that come our way with questions.\\r\\nThis time there were only three of us hostin\ng; Denise Tineghe, Josh Arrowsmith and myself, people who I have worked with before at previous Hackathons and events.\\r\\nFor a work day, the time during these events goes ridiculously fast.\\r\\nWe manned the comput\ning desk in the basement once more and talked amongst ourselves as we prepared work to show to any visitors that wished to see what our studies entail.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBefore we knew it the time had come again to\n migrate up to the computing labs and give our presentations on what our journey has been like at the university so far.\\r\\nLast time, there were so many visitors that we split the group in two and had 3 of the stu\ndents go in the other room to present and me on my own to talk about the networking course.\\r\\nThis time the group was small enough to keep together, so it was nice to see how other people\\'s presentations played o\nut and how they present themselves to others.\\r\\nDenise showed off her Twitter account, explaining all the events she\\'s been to and won, Josh spoke about how he\\'s grown into the confident person he is now across\nthe past two years, and I gave an updated presentation from last time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt the end of the talks, we go around the room and speak individually with the visitors and answer any questions they may hav\ne about the course and get to know them better.\\r\\nWhen all the visitors were happy with what they saw and left the room, we returned down to the desk until the end of our shift.\\r\\nLike last time, we celebrated th\ne end of the day by going out together and having a great time.\\r\\n</p>	f
5	PastNet 2019	pastnet2019	2020-05-05	2019-05-11	2019-05-11	Hackathon	Team MIND go to Oxford University to compete against other teams in a hackathon aimed around feeding past data into visuali\nsation algorithms.	past_net_19	<p>\\r\\nI was originally introduced to the <a href=\\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/pastnet-hackathon-network-science-of-the-past-tickets-58541996688#\\">PastNet Hackathon</a> by\nPrins, who told me that the event was about networking - which was a skill of mine I\\'ve wanted to put to good use since starting my course.\\r\\nI agreed to sign up before the event handlers had even released any su\nbstantial information as to what the hackathon was even about.\\r\\nWeeks went by and the event had completely escaped my mind as no new information was being released for it.\\r\\nWe knew in advance our team would con\nsist of past members; Prins Butt, Denise Tineghe, Josh Arrowsmith, myself and new timer, Ryan Jordan.\\r\\nWe students were out celebrating in town for finishing our year at University, partying late into the night t\nhe night before and planning to go home and get some sleep before we had to wake up early to drive up to Oxford the next day.\\r\\nNeedless to day, I didn\\'t sleep at all and the member of the team who had the most s\nleep got 4 hours - something that was seeming to become an inevitable tradition when it comes to hackathons for us.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLeaving at 7am for Oxford as a team, we arrive slightly late due to traffic but\nmanage to still catch the opening presentations which told us what the hackathon was all about.\\r\\nThe hackathon organisers were all Oxford PhD students and they introduced several different members of the team, sa\nying where they specialised and what they expected of us - the vast majority of them were in Archaeology related studies.\\r\\nThis is where I learned I was lied to.\\r\\nThe hackathon wasn\\'t to do with networking at\nall, but instead about feeding past data into visualisation algorithms and making sense of the output, with the main data focus being Roman clay pots.\\r\\nRegardless of this betrayal, we were still ready to put our\nminds to use and see what we could make of our situation as I kept fuelling myself with coffee to try combat the lack of sleep during the day.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAfter sitting through a few hours of presentations, w\ne only had about 4 hours to come up with an idea for our project and begin developing it - something that has been far more restrictive due to time constraints compared to all last events, which proved a very diffi\ncult obstacle when it comes to developing an innovative idea.\\r\\nOne thing we all agreed on was that we didn\\'t want to use data for Roman clay pots or any other past data they recommended to us for our project as\nwe felt that wasn\\'t what made our team motivated.\\r\\nDue to that fact, we ended up with far less time to make a working implementation for our project as we had to devote a lot of our time thinking of what is was\nwe wanted to tackle.\\r\\nThe criteria we took from the organisers that we needed to meet was that it had to be past data and it had to be able to be fed into a visualisation algorithm for us to do something with the\n output.\\r\\nWith that information in mind, we left the building and sat outside on the grass next to a fountain with ducks to think with clear minds.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAfter much discussion, we concluded that we wa\nnted to tackle the issue of mental health, which is a serious issue within our society but still needed to decide how we were going to do that.\\r\\nAs usual we spit-balled as many different ideas that came to our he\nads as possible and weighed all their likelihood of being a strong standpoint to begin to combating mental health.\\r\\nOur final idea was to take past social media posts and feed only the use of emojis into the visu\nalisation algorithm to get a general idea as to the overall mental health of the population in any given area.\\r\\nWe could in future versions find out what it is in particular that is causing these people to use mo\nre negative emojis.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy the time that idea was finalised we only had about 2 hours to make our project into a presentation, so we split into mini groups to focus on individual aspects simultaneousl\ny.\\r\\nJosh and Ryan worked on the presentation slides, Denise created an infographic on the state of mental health and myself and Prins focused on creating the graphical interface that would present the visualised\ndata as emojis on a map.\\r\\nWe spent time developing the beginnings of the interface in C# but very quickly realised that the time we had remaining was not enough to develop a program that could use the Twitter API\n to scrape tweets and feed that into our program.\\r\\nWe decided that our best option was to produce proof of concept slides that would show a rough idea as to what our project foresaw.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs we were\noutside and had laptops, we needed to find somewhere with an internet connection and power sockets.\\r\\nThe Oxford building was available to us, but it was very cramped in there and we wanted somewhere to have more\nprivacy.\\r\\nWe walked around Oxford looking for a place to work.\\r\\nHaving tried many places (including the history museum), we eventually found a small cafe that provided all we needed, losing us about 45 minutes\nin the process.\\r\\nWith no time to lose, we all kept our heads down and got working hard to try meet our deadline, talking to each other where needed to get feedback but ultimately working independently of one anot\nher.\\r\\nWe gave ourselves 15 minutes to group all our work together and walk back to the university in time for the final presentations.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDue to the lack of sleep, my memory of the events are a bit\n hazy.\\r\\nI think it was around the time of arrival for the presentations that the hackathon organisers had a lunch prepared for us on a higher floor of the building.\\r\\nWe worked our way up there to see what was o\nn offer.\\r\\nSide note about me - I <em>really</em> don\\'t enjoy eating most healthy foods.\\r\\nMost of today\\'s society is trying to eliminate people like me through attrition by making sure all sandwiches contain e\nither mayonnaise or a bunch of healthy salad stuff.\\r\\nBack to the point - all the food there was healthy... <em>too healthy</em>.\\r\\nI was left to starve.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHungry, tired and over-caffeinated, my b\nody was refusing to work more than I was refusing to eat the rabbit food on offer.\\r\\nLooking around the room, I noticed a familiar face on the far side talking to two women.\\r\\nThe face was the boyfriend to a dear\n friend of mine who lives in Southampton - why would her boyfriend be all the way out here? To do a hackathon like me, of course.\\r\\nI walked over there to say hello.\\r\\nAs he is in conversation with the two ladies\n I don\\'t interrupt, I just stood there waiting for the conversation to finish.\\r\\nThe man was aware I was there, and I was curious as to why he didn\\'t immediately acknowledge me and say hello at least.\\r\\nJust as\n the conversation between he and the ladies got awkward due to my presence, it dawned upon me.\\r\\nI did not know this man because he was my friend\\'s boyfriend; I knew his man because I sat next to him in the intro\nduction.\\r\\nEmbarrassed, and too tired to come up with some fake conversation, I waved and said hello to them all and then quickly walked off.\\r\\nI had to ensure my eyes did not meet his, nor the ladies the entire\ntime we were up there until we all went down for presentations.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUpon arriving, we volunteered to present first but as usual we kept the number of people going up to present to a minimum, being onl\ny Prins and Denise.\\r\\nWith not enough time to study through what everyone had produced or even rehearse the presentation, it was mostly improvisation on Prins\\' part, of which he handled gracefully.\\r\\nThey gave a\n 3 minute presentation showing the others what we had created with our given time.\\r\\nAfter the time was up, the judges asked questions for each of the presentations, and watched all the other teams present their s\nubmissions.\\r\\nMost of the other teams also consisted of Oxford PhD students and they all gave their presentations of feeding past data of Roman clay pots into the algorithm and having similar outcomes to each othe\nr.\\r\\nI thought those who didn\\'t study history were doomed to repeat it.\\r\\nOnce all the presentations were given, the judges left the room for 5 minutes to decide on their winning teams.\\r\\nWe felt our team had t\nhought really outside of the box and tried to make something of real impact, hoping that would bide well with the judges.\\r\\nWhen the judges returned, they first stressed that they decided on their winners on those\n who met the criteria the most and announced the teams that won 1st, 2nd and 3rd place; positions that we did not achieve.\\r\\nIt seemed that the judges were only interested in those who used the past data that they\n suggested, but we still won prizes regardless, all walking away with mini gifts - myself, an egg timer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn conclusion, we were all very happy that we chose what we did, otherwise the event would\nnot have been as engaging as we\\'d have liked and the day over all was an enjoyable experience.\\r\\nWe developed an idea that we felt had real weight to it and would iterate on it in future hackathons to come.\\r\\nAf\nter the event finished, we explored Oxford city for a while before coming back to Southampton and enjoying a night celebrating our experience.\\r\\n</p>	f
